The Functions of Tadārammaṇa and Cuti 
=====================================

An object which impinges on one of the senses can be visible object,
sound, odour, flavour or tangible object. Each of these objects is rūpa.
They arise and fall away, but they do not fall away as rapidly as nāma.
As we have seen (in chapter 12), rūpa lasts as long as seventeen moments
of citta. When a sense object which is rūpa impinges on one of the
senses, a process of cittas occurs which arise in a particular order and
perform each their own function while they experience that sense object.
The first citta of that process, the pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta,
five-door-adverting-consciousness, does not arise immediately. First
there have to be bhavanga-cittas and these are: atīta-bhavanga, past
bhavanga, bhavanga-calana, vibrating bhavanga, and bhavangupaccheda,
arrest-bhavanga or last bhavanga before the current of bhavanga-cittas
is arrested. These bhavanga-cittas do not experience the rūpa which
impinges on one of the senses. The pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta, which is a
kiriyacitta, adverts to the object and is then succeeded by one of the
dvi-pañca-viññāṇas (seeing-consciousness, hearing-consciousness, etc.)
which is vipāka, the result of a good deed or a bad deed. There is,
however, not only one moment of vipāka in a process, but several
moments. The pañca-viññāṇa (sense-cognition) is succeeded by
sampaṭicchana-citta (receiving-consciousness) which is vipāka and this
citta is succeeded by santīraṇa-citta (investigating-consciousness)
which is also vipāka. The santīraṇa-citta is succeeded by the
votthapana-citta (determining-consciousness) which is kiriyacitta. This
citta is succeeded by seven javana-cittas [(55)](#FOOT55) which are, in
the case of non-arahats, akusala cittas or kusala cittas. All cittas,
starting with the pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta, experience the object which
impinges on one of the senses. Counting from the atīta-bhavanga, fifteen
moments of citta have elapsed when the seventh javana-citta has fallen
away. If the rūpa which has impinged on one of the senses and
atīta-bhavanga arose at the same time, that rūpa can survive two more
moments of citta, since the duration of rūpa equals seventeen moments of
citta. Thus, after the javana-cittas there can be two more moments of
citta which directly experience the object. These cittas, which are
vipākacittas, are tadārammaṇa-cittas or tadālambana-cittas. They perform
the function of *tadārammaṇa* or tadālambana, which is translated as
“registering” or “retention”. Tadārammaṇa literally means “that object”;
the citta “hangs on” to that object. When the tadārammaṇa-cittas have
fallen away the sense-door process has run its full course. There is,
however, not always a complete sense-door process. When a rūpa which
impinges on one of the senses, more than three moments of
bhavanga-cittas may pass before a process starts and then the process
cannot run its full course. Since rūpa does not last longer than
seventeen moments of citta, it falls away before the tadārammaṇa-cittas
could arise. Thus, in that case there are no tadārammaṇa-cittas
[(56)](#FOOT56).

Only in the sensuous plane of existence kamma can, after kāmāvacara
javana-cittas (of the sense-sphere), produce the vipākacittas which are
the tadārammaṇa-cittas, “hanging on” to the sense object
[(57)](#FOOT57). For those who are born in rūpa-brahma-planes where
there are less conditions for sense-impressions, and for those who are
born in arūpa-brahma planes where there are no sense-impressions, there
are no tadārammaṇa-cittas [(58)](#FOOT58).

Summarising the cittas which succeed one another when a rūpa impinges on
one of the senses and becomes the object of cittas of a sense-door
process which runs its full course:

1. Atīta-bhavanga (past bhavanga)
2. Bhavanga-calana (vibrating bhavanga)
3. Bhavangupaccheda (arrest-bhavanga)
4. Pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta (five-door-adverting-consciousness)
5. Dvi-pañca-viññāṇa (the five pairs of seeing-consciousness, etc.)
6. Sampaṭicchana-citta (receiving-consciousness)
7. Santīraṇa-citta (investigating-consciousness)
8. Votthapana-citta (determining-consciousness)
9. Javana-cittas
10. ditto kusala cittas or akusala cittas
11. ditto (in the case of non-arahats)
12. ditto “running through the object”
13. ditto
14. ditto
15. ditto
16. Tadārammaṇa-citta (registering-consciousness)
17. ditto

The tadārammaṇa-citta experiences an object not only through the five
sense-doors but also through the mind-door. In the sense-door process
tadārammaṇa-citta can arise only when the object has not fallen away
yet. If tadārammaṇa-cittas arise in a sense-door process they can also
arise in the succeeding mind-door process. The tadārammaṇa-citta is a
vipākacitta which can experience an object through six doors. For
example, when visible object contacts the eyesense and the process runs
its full course, the tadārammaṇa-cittas arising in that process
experience the object through the eye-door. The tadārammaṇa-cittas of
the mind-door process which succeeds the eye-door process experience
that object through the mind-door [(59)](#FOOT59). When the object which
contacts the sense-door is unpleasant, all the vipākacittas in that
process and thus also the tadārammaṇa-cittas, if they arise, are akusala
vipāka. The tadārammaṇa-cittas of the succeeding mind-door process are
also akusala vipāka. When the object which contacts the sense-door is
pleasant, all vipākacittas of that process, including the
tadārammaṇa-cittas, are kusala vipāka. It is the same with the
tadārammaṇa-cittas of the subsequent mind-door process.

The function of tadārammaṇa can be performed by eleven different types
of vipākacitta: by three ahetuka vipākacittas (unaccompanied by hetus,
roots) and by eight sahetuka vipākacittas (accompanied by sobhana hetus,
beautiful roots).

If the tadārammaṇa-citta is ahetuka, the function of tadārammaṇa is
performed by the ahetuka vipākacitta which is classified as
santīraṇa-citta. As we have seen (in chapter 9), there are three kinds
of santīraṇa-citta: one type is akusala vipāka accompanied by upekkhā
(indifferent feeling), one type is kusala vipāka, accompanied by
upekkhā, and one type is kusala vipāka, accompanied by somanassa
(pleasant feeling). As stated before (in chapter 11), santīraṇa-citta
can perform more than one function at different occasions.
Santīraṇa-citta performs the function of santīraṇa (investigating the
object) when it arises in a sense-door process and succeeds
sampaṭicchana-citta. Apart from the function of investigating the
object, santīraṇa-citta can also perform the functions of paṭisandhi
(rebirth), bhavanga and cuti (dying). In those cases santīraṇa-citta
does not arise within a process of cittas. Moreover, santīraṇa-citta can
perform the function of tadārammaṇa. Apart from the three ahetuka
vipākacittas which can perform the function of tadārammaṇa, there are
eight sahetuka vipākacittas or mahā-vipākacittas which can perform the
function of tadārammaṇa.

All the time cittas arise and fall away, performing different functions.
The last function of citta in life is the function of *cuti* (dying).
When we say in conventional language that a person has died, the
cuti-citta (dying-consciousness), which is the last citta of that life,
has fallen away. The cuti-citta is succeeded by the paṭisandhi-citta
(rebirth-consciousness) of the following life.

Death is unavoidable. Everybody, no matter whether he is in one of the
unhappy planes, in the human plane or in one of the heavenly planes, has
to have cuti-citta. We read in the teachings about birth, old age,
sickness and death. Old age is mentioned immediately after birth, before
sickness is mentioned. The reason is that as soon as we are born, we are
already ageing, we are already on our way to death. We read in the
Sutta-Nipāta (The Group of Discourses, chapter III, paragraph 8, The
Barb, vs. 574-587, Khuddaka Nikāya):

> The life of mortals here cannot be predicted by any sign, and (its
> duration) is uncertain. (It is) difficult and brief, and it is
> combined with misery.
>
> For there is no means whereby those born do not die. Even (for one)
> arriving at old age there is death, for of such a nature are living
> creatures.
>
> Just as for ripe fruit there is constantly fear of falling, so for
> mortals who are born there is constantly fear of death.
>
> Just as vessels made of clay by a potter all have breaking as their
> end, so is the life of mortals.
>
> Young and old, those who are foolish and those who are wise, all go
> into the power of death, all have death as their end.
>
> When they are overcome by death, going from here to the next world,
> the father does not protect the son, nor the relatives the (other)
> relatives.
>
> See, while the relatives are actually looking on, (and) wailing much,
> each one of the mortals is led away like a cow to be slaughtered.
>
> Thus the world is smitten by death and old age. Therefore wise men do
> not grieve, knowing the way of the world.
>
> Whose path you do not know, whether come or gone, not seeing both ends
> you lament (him) uselessly.
>
> If lamenting (and) harming himself a deluded person should pluck out
> any advantage (from his action), a wise man would do that too.
>
> For not by weeping and grief does one obtain peace of mind. His misery
> arises all the more, his body is harmed.
>
> He becomes thin and discoloured, harming himself by himself. The
> departed ones do not fare well thereby. Lamentation is useless.
>
> Not abandoning grief a person goes all the more to misery. Bewailing
> the dead man he goes under the influence of grief...

If one is not wise, one grieves, but for those who develop the eightfold
Path, there will be less sorrow. For him who has attained the stage of
the arahat, there will be cuti-citta, but it will not be succeeded by
paṭisandhi-citta. Then the end to birth, old age, sickness and death has
been reached.

We read in the Gradual Sayings (Book of the Threes, chapter VII,
paragraph 62, Terror, V and VI):

> Monks, these three terrors part mother and son. What three?
>
> A mother cannot bear to see her son grow old. She says, “I am growing
> old. Let not my son grow old.” The son likewise cannot bear to see his
> mother grow old. He says, “I am growing old. Let not my mother grow
> old.” And it is the same with regard to getting sick and dying. These
> are the three terrors that part mother and son.
>
> But, monks, there is a way, there is a practice that leads to the
> abandoning, to the overpassing of these three terrors that part mother
> and son, a way which joins mother and son. What is that way, what is
> that practice which so leads?
>
> It is just this Eightfold Way, to wit: Right view, right thinking,
> right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
> mindfulness, right concentration. That is the way, that is the
> practice...

The eightfold Path eventually leads to the end of birth, old age,
sickness and death. If one is not an arahat, there will be a
paṭisandhi-citta succeeding the cuti-citta. Before the cuti-citta
arises, there are only five javana-cittas instead of seven, because the
javana process is weaker due to the nearness of death (Vis. chapter
XVII, 143). These are the last javana-cittas of that lifespan. If
akusala kamma produces the rebirth of the next life there will be an
unhappy rebirth. In that case the last javana-cittas are akusala cittas
and they experience an unpleasant object. If kusala kamma produces the
rebirth there will be a happy rebirth. In that case the last
javana-cittas are kusala cittas and they experience a pleasant object
[(60)](#FOOT60). These javana-cittas experience an object through one of
the sense-doors or through the mind-door. The object that presents
itself to the dying person may be the past kamma that will condition his
rebirth, a sign of past kamma, a sign of his future destiny or any
object that is experienced through one of the senses (Vis. XVII,
136-146). The tadārammaṇa-citta which has as function to register the
object may or may not follow. Then the cuti-citta arises, the last citta
of this present life. The cuti-citta is succeeded by the
paṭisandhi-citta of the following life and this citta experiences the
same object as the last javana-cittas arising before the cuti-citta of
the previous life. Whatever that object may have been, the
paṭisandhi-citta of the new life and also all bhavanga-cittas arising in
the course of that new life and finally the cuti-citta of that life
experience that object. There is sometimes a misunderstanding that the
cuti-citta of the previous life determines one’s rebirth, but this is
not so. The only function of the cuti-citta is being the last moment of
a lifespan. The cuti-citta is vipākacitta produced by the kamma which
produced the paṭisandhi-citta and the bhavanga-cittas of the life which
is just ending; it is of the same type as these cittas and it
experiences the same object. Past kusala kamma or akusala kamma which
will produce one’s rebirth conditions the last javana-cittas to
experience a pleasant object or an unpleasant object.

The paṭisandhi-citta, the bhavanga-cittas and the cuti-citta in one
lifespan are the same type of vipākacitta and they experience the same
object. There are nineteen types of citta which can perform the function
of paṭisandhi [(61)](#FOOT61) and the function of bhavanga, and these
same nineteen types of citta can perform the function of cuti.

If someone suffers great pains before he dies because of an accident or
sickness, the last javana-cittas arising before the cuti-citta will not
necessarily be akusala cittas. There may be akusala cittas with aversion
when he feels the pain, but the last javana-cittas may be kusala cittas,
depending on the kamma which will produce his next birth.

We read in the Gradual Sayings (Book of the Sixes, chapter VI, paragraph
2, Phagguna) that the Buddha visited the venerable Phagguna who was very
ill. Phagguna had attained the second stage of enlightenment (the stage
of the sakadāgāmī, once-returner); he was not yet completely freed from
the “five lower fetters”. We read in the sutta that the Buddha said to
Phagguna:

> “I hope, Phagguna, you’re bearing up, keeping going; that your aches
> and pains grow less, not more; that there are signs of their growing
> less, not more?”
>
> “Lord, I can neither bear up nor keep going; my aches and pains grow
> grievously more, not less; and there are signs of their growing more,
> not less.
>
> Lord, the violent ache that racks my head is just as though some lusty
> fellow chopped at it with a sharp-edged sword; lord, I can neither
> bear up nor keep going; my pains grow more, not less...”
>
> So the Exalted One instructed him, roused him, gladdened him and
> comforted him with Dhamma-talk, then rose from his seat and departed.
>
> Now not long after the Exalted One’s departure, the venerable Phagguna
> died; and at the time of his death his faculties were completely
> purified.
>
> Then went the venerable Ānanda to the Exalted One, saluted him, and
> sat down at one side. So seated, he said:
>
> “Lord, not long after the Exalted One left, the venerable Phagguna
> died; and at that time his faculties were completely purified.”
>
> “But why, Ānanda, should not the faculties of the monk Phagguna have
> been completely purified? The monk’s mind, Ānanda, had not been wholly
> freed from the five lower fetters; but, when he heard that Dhamma
> teaching, his mind was wholly freed.
>
> There are these six advantages, Ānanda, in hearing Dhamma in time, in
> testing its goodness in time. What six?
>
> Consider, Ānanda, the monk whose mind is not wholly freed from the
> five lower fetters, but, when dying, is able to see the Tathāgata: the
> Tathāgata teaches him Dhamma, lovely in the beginning, lovely in the
> middle, lovely in the end, its goodness, its significance; and makes
> known the brahman-life [(62)](#FOOT62), wholly fulfilled, perfectly
> pure. When he has heard that Dhamma teaching, his mind is wholly freed
> from the five lower fetters [(63)](#FOOT63). This, Ānanda, is the
> first advantage in hearing Dhamma in time.
>
> Or ...though not just able to see the Tathāgata, sees his disciple, who

The same is said with regard to the monk who has attained the third
stage of enlightenment (the stage of the anāgāmī), and who, after
hearing Dhamma in time and testing its goodness in time, can attain the
stage of the arahat.
