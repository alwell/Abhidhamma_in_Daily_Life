The First Citta in Life 
=======================

Time and again there are cittas arising which experience different
objects through the senses and through the mind-door. There are seeing
or hearing, there are cittas with attachment to what is seen or heard.
These cittas arise because of different conditions. Seeing and the citta
with attachment to visible object do not arise at the same time, they
are different and they perform different functions. We will understand
more about cittas if we know in what order they arise and which function
they perform. Each citta has its own function (in Pāli: kicca). There
are fourteen functions of citta in all.

The citta arising at the first moment of life must also have a function.
What is birth, and what is it actually that is born? We speak about the
birth of a child, but in fact, there are only nāma and rūpa which are
born. The word “birth” is a conventional term. We should consider what
birth really is. Nāma and rūpa arise and fall away all the time and thus
there is birth and death of nāma and rūpa all the time. In order to
understand what causes birth we should know what conditions the nāma and
rūpa which arise at the first moment of a new lifespan.

What arises first at the beginning of our life, nāma or rūpa? At any
moment of our life there have to be both nāma and rūpa. In the planes of
existence where there are five khandhas (four nāmakkhandhas and one
rūpakkhandha), nāma cannot arise without rūpa; citta cannot arise
without the body [(37)](#FOOT37). What is true for any moment of our
life is also true for the first moment of our life. At the first moment
of our life nāma and rūpa have to arise at the same time. The citta
which arises at that moment is called the rebirth-consciousness or
*paṭisandhi-citta* [(38)](#FOOT38). Since there isn’t any citta which
arises without conditions, the paṭisandhi-citta must also have
conditions. The paṭisandhi-citta is the first citta of a new life and
thus its cause can only be in the past. One may have doubts about past
lives, but how can people be so different if there were no past lives?
We can see that people are born with different accumulations. Can we
explain the character of a child only by the parents? What we mean by
“character” is actually nāma. Could parents transfer to another being
nāma which falls away as soon as it has arisen? There must be other
factors which are the condition for a child’s character. Cittas which
arise and fall away succeed one another and thus each citta conditions
the next one. The last citta of the previous life (dying-consciousness)
is succeeded by the first citta of this life. That is why tendencies one
had in the past can continue by way of accumulation from one citta to
the next one and from past lives to the present life. Since people
accumulated different tendencies in past lives, they are born with
different tendencies and inclinations.

We do not only see that people are born with different characters, we
also see that they are born in different surroundings; some people are
born in pleasant surroundings and some people are born in miserable
surroundings. In order to understand this we should not cling to
conventional terms such as “person” or “surroundings”. If we think in
terms of paramattha dhammas we will see that being in pleasant or
miserable surroundings is nothing else but the receiving of pleasant or
unpleasant objects through eyes, ears, nose, tongue and bodysense. It is
kusala vipāka or akusala vipāka. Vipāka (result) does not arise without
conditions; it is caused by good or bad deeds, by kamma. Different
people perform different kamma and each deed brings its own result. The
fact that people are born in different surroundings must have a
condition: it is conditioned by kamma performed in a previous life.
Kamma causes one to be born. The paṭisandhi-citta is the result of
kamma; it is vipāka.

In this world we see different births of people and of animals. When we
compare the life of an animal with the life of a human being, we notice
that being born an animal is sorrowful; it is akusala vipāka. Being born
a human being is kusala vipāka, even if one is born poor or if one has
to experience many unpleasant things during one’s life. The
paṭisandhi-cittas of different people are of many different degrees of
kusala vipāka because the kusala kammas which produced them were of
different degrees.

At the first moment of our life kamma produces the paṭisandhi-citta and
then rūpa has to arise at the same time. One may wonder what the cause
is of the rūpa arising at the first moment of life. We see that people
are born with different bodily features: some are strong, some are weak,
some are handicapped from birth. This must have a cause. It is kamma
which causes both nāma and rūpa to be born.

Could the rūpa we call “dead matter” and the rūpa we call “plant” be
produced by kamma? A plant is not “born” because a plant cannot perform
good and bad deeds; it has no kamma that could cause its birth.
Temperature is the condition for the life of a plant. As regards human
beings, kamma produces rūpa at the moment the paṭisandhi-citta arises.
There couldn’t be life if kamma did not produce rūpa from the first
moment of life. There are four factors which produce different rūpas of
the body. As we have seen kamma is one factor. The other factors are:
citta, temperature and nutrition. Kamma produces rūpa at the moment the
paṭisandhi-citta arises and after that the other factors also start to
produce rūpas. Temperature produces rūpa; if there were not the right
temperature the new life could not develop. Temperature produces rūpa
throughout our life. As soon as the paṭisandhi-citta has fallen away, at
the moment the next citta arises, citta too starts to produce rūpa, and
it produces rūpa throughout our life. Furthermore, nutrition produces
rūpa so that the body can grow. It produces rūpa throughout our life.
Thus we see that there are four factors which produce rūpas of the body.

As regards rūpas which are not of the body but rūpas outside, such as
rūpas in dead matter or in plants, these are produced solely by
temperature.

Kamma produces rūpa not only at the first moment of life but throughout
our life. Kamma does not only produce the vipākacittas which experience
pleasant and unpleasant objects through the sense-doors, it also
produces throughout our life the rūpas which can function as the
sense-doors through which these objects are received. Could we for
instance create our own eyesense? It could not be produced by
temperature, only by kamma. Transplantation of the eye cannot be
successful unless kamma produces eyesense in the body of the receiver.

Birth by way of the mother’s womb is not the only way of birth. We learn
from the teachings that there can be birth in four different ways: by
way of the womb, by way of eggs, by way of moisture and by way of
spontaneous birth.

People would like to know when life starts in the mother’s womb. We
cannot determine the exact moment. Life starts at the moment the
paṭisandhi-citta arises together with the rūpa which is at the same time
produced by kamma. A lifespan ends when the last citta, the
dying-consciousness (cuti-citta) falls away. So long as the
dying-consciousness has not fallen away there is still life. One cannot
know the moment the dying-consciousness of someone else arises and falls
away unless one has cultivated the knowledge of the cittas of other
people. A Buddha or someone else who has cultivated this special kind of
knowledge could know the exact moment of someone’s death.

We may wonder which kamma in our life will produce the paṭisandhi-citta
of the next life. Some people believe that by doing many good deeds in
this life they can be assured of a happy rebirth. But the kamma which
produces rebirth will not necessarily be from this life. We have in past
lives as well as in this life performed both akusala kamma and kusala
kamma and these kammas are of different degrees. Some kammas produce
results in the same life in which they have been performed, some produce
result in the form of rebirth-consciousness of a future life, or they
produce result in the course of a future life. We have performed deeds
in past lives which could produce rebirth but which have not yet come to
fruition. We cannot know which kamma will produce our next rebirth.

If akusala kamma produces the rebirth of the next life there will be an
unhappy rebirth. In that case the cittas which arise shortly before the
dying-consciousness are akusala cittas and they experience an unpleasant
object. The paṭisandhi-citta of the next life which succeeds the
cuti-citta (the dying-consciousness), experiences that same unpleasant
object. If kusala kamma produces the rebirth there will be a happy
rebirth. In that case kusala cittas arise shortly before the cuti-citta
and they experience a pleasant object. The paṭisandhi-citta of the next
life experiences that same pleasant object.

People want to know whether they can ensure a happy rebirth for
themselves by controlling the last cittas before the cuti-citta, by
inducing them to be kusala. Some people invite monks to chant at the
deathbed of a dying person in order to help him to have kusala cittas.
However, nobody can be sure that his rebirth will be a happy one, unless
he has attained one of the stages of enlightenment. One cannot have
power over one’s cittas. Can we control our thoughts now, at this
moment? Since we cannot do this, how could we control our thoughts at
the time shortly before dying? There is no self who can decide about his
rebirth in a next life. After the last akusala cittas or kusala cittas
in life have fallen away, the cuti-citta arises. The cuti-citta is
succeeded by the paṭisandhi-citta of the next life. When the
paṭisandhi-citta arises a new lifespan starts. So long as there is kamma
there will be future lives.

The paṭisandhi-citta performs the function of rebirth or relinking. It
“links” the past to the present. Since only the first citta of a
lifespan performs the function of rebirth there is only one
paṭisandhi-citta in a life. There is no self who transmigrates from one
life to the next life; there are only nāma and rūpa arising and falling
away. The present life is different from the past life but there is
continuity in so far as the present life is conditioned by the past.
Since the paṭisandhi-citta succeeds the cuti-citta of the previous life,
the accumulated tendencies of past lives go on to the paṭisandhi-citta.
Thus, inclinations one has in the present life are conditioned by the
past.

The paṭisandhi-citta is the result of a previous good deed or bad deed
committed in the past. The object the paṭisandhi-citta experiences is,
as we have seen, the same as the object experienced by the last akusala
cittas or kusala cittas which arose before the cuti-citta of the
previous life. The Visuddhimagga (XVII, 164-168) explains by way of
similes that although the present is different from the past there is
continuity. The being who is born is not the same as the being of the
past life, but it is conditioned by the past. There is “neither absolute
identity nor absolute otherness”, as the Visuddhimagga explains. We read
with regard to the paṭisandhi-citta:


   
 
	 An echo, or its like, supplies 
	 The figures here; connectedness 
	 By continuity denies 
	 Identity and otherness. 
	 


> And here let the illustration of this consciousness be such things as
> an echo, a light, a seal impression, a looking glass image, for the
> fact of its not coming here from the previous becoming and for the

One is glad to be born if one does not realize that birth is the result
of kamma and that one will go forth in the cycle of birth and death so
long as there is kamma. Not seeing the dangers of birth is ignorance. At
this moment we are in the human plane of existence but so long as we
have not attained any stage of enlightenment we cannot be sure that
there will not be rebirth in one of the woeful planes. We all have
performed both akusala kamma and kusala kamma in different lives. Who
knows which of those deeds will produce the paṭisandhi-citta of the next
life, even if we continue doing good deeds? Some people think that birth
in a heavenly plane is desirable, but they do not realize that life in a
heavenly plane does not last and that, after a lifespan in heaven is
over, an ill deed previously performed could produce a paṭisandhi-citta
in a woeful plane.

We read in the “Discourse on Fools and the Wise” (Middle Length Sayings
III, 129) that the Buddha, when he was staying in the Jeta Grove, in
Anāthapiṇḍika monastery, spoke to the monks about the sufferings in hell
and about the anguishes of animal birth. The Buddha said:

> “In many a disquisition could I, monks, talk a talk about animal
> birth, but it is not easy to describe in full, monks, so many are the
> anguishes of animal birth.
>
> Monks, it is like a man who might throw a yoke with one hole into the
> sea. An easterly wind might take it westwards, a westerly wind might
> take it eastwards, a northerly wind might take it southwards, a
> southerly wind might take it northwards. There might be a blind turtle
> there who came to the surface once in a hundred years. What do you
> think, monks? Could that blind turtle push his neck through that one
> hole in the yoke?”
>
> “If at all, revered sir, then only once in a very long while.”
>
> “Sooner or later, monks, could the blind turtle push his neck through
> the one hole in the yoke; more difficult than that, do I say, monks,
> is human status once again for the fool who has gone to the Downfall.
> What is the cause of that? Monks, there is no dhamma-faring there, no
> even-faring, no doing of what is skilled, no doing of what is good.
> Monks, there is devouring of one another there and feeding on the
> weak. Monks, if some time or other once in a very long while that fool
> came to human status (again), he would be born into those families
> that are low: a family of low caste or a family of hunters or a family
> of bamboo-plaiters or a family of cartwrights or a family of

>
> ...This, monks, is the fool’s condition, completed in its entirety...”

The Buddha spoke about the dangers of birth in many different ways. He
said that birth is dukkha (sorrow); it is followed by old age, sickness
and death. He pointed out the foulness of the body and he reminded
people that also at this very moment the body is dukkha, impermanent and
non-self. If we continue taking mind and body for self there will be no
end to the cycle of birth and death.

We read in the Kindred Sayings (II, Nidāna-vagga, chapter XV, Kindred
Sayings on the Incalculable Beginning, paragraph 10, A Person) that the
Buddha, when he was in Rājagaha, on Vulture’s Peak, said to the monks:

> Incalculable is the beginning, monks, of this faring on. The earliest
> point is not revealed of the running on, faring on of beings, cloaked
> in ignorance, tied by craving...
>
> The bones of one single person, monks, running on, faring on for an
> aeon would be a cairn, a pile, a heap as great as Mount Vepulla, were
> there a collector of those bones and the collection were not
> destroyed.
>
> How is this? Incalculable is the beginning, monks, of this faring on.
> The earliest point is not revealed of the running on, faring on of
> beings, cloaked in ignorance, tied by craving...
>
> Thus spoke the Exalted One. After the Wellfarer had said this, he
> spoke further:


   
 
	 The pile of bones (of all the bodies of) one man 
	 Who has alone one aeon lived, 
	 Were heaped a mountain high - so said the mighty seer - 
	 Yes, reckoned high as Vipula 
	 To north of Vulture's Peak, crag-fort of Magadha. 
	 When he with perfect insight sees 
	 The Ariyan Truths: - what dukkha is and how it comes 
	 And how it may be overpassed, 
	 The Ariyan Eightfold Path, the way all ill to abate - 
	 Seven times at most reborn, a man 
	 Yet running on, through breaking every fetter down, 
	 Endmaker does become of dukkha. 
 


It is fortunate to be born in the human plane where we can cultivate
insight. When the first stage of enlightenment (the stage of the
sotāpanna) has been attained, the four noble Truths have been directly
understood. Then we will not be reborn more than seven times and we can
be sure that there will eventually be an end to rebirth.
