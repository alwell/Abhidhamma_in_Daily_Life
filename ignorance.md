Ignorance 
=========

We may know when we have akusala cittas rooted in lobha (attachment) or
akusala cittas rooted in dosa (aversion), but do we know when we have
akusala cittas rooted in *moha* (ignorance)? What is the characteristic
of moha? We may think someone ignorant who does not have much education,
who does not speak foreign languages, who does not know anything about
history or politics. We call someone ignorant who does not know what is
happening in the world. Is that the kind of ignorance which should be
eradicated? If that were true it would mean that there is more
wholesomeness in one’s life if one speaks foreign languages or if one
knows about history and politics. We can find out that this is not true.

In order to understand the characteristic of moha we should know what we
are ignorant of when there is moha. There is the world of concepts which
in our daily, ordinary language are denoted by conventional terms and
there is the world of paramattha dhammas or ultimate realities. When we
think of the concept which in conventional language is denoted by
“world”, we may think of people, animals and things and we call them by
their appropriate names. But do we know the phenomena in ourselves and
around ourselves as they really are: only nāma and rūpa which do not
last?

The world of paramattha dhammas is real. Nāma and rūpa are paramattha
dhammas. The nāmas and rūpas which appear in our daily life can be
directly experienced through the five sense-doors and the mind-door, no
matter how we name them. This is the world which is real. When we see,
there is the world of visible object. When we hear, there is the world
of sound. When we experience an object through touch there is the world
of tangible object. Visible object and seeing are real. Their
characteristics cannot be altered and they can be directly experienced;
it does not matter whether we call them “visible object” and “seeing”,
or whether we give them another name. But when we cling to concepts
which are denoted by conventional terms such as “tree” or “chair”, we do
not experience any characteristic of reality. What is real when we look
at a tree? What can be directly experienced? Visible object is a
paramattha dhamma, a reality; it is a kind of rūpa which can be directly
experienced through the eyes. Through touch hardness can be experienced;
this is a kind of rūpa which can be directly experienced through the
bodysense, it is real. “Tree” is a concept or idea of which we can
think, but it is not a paramattha dhamma, not a reality which has its
own unchangeable characteristic. Visible object and hardness are
paramattha dhammas, they have their own characteristics which can be
directly experienced, no matter how one names them.

The world experienced through the six doors is real, but it does not
last; it is impermanent. When we see, there is the world of the visible,
but it falls away immediately. When we hear, there is the world of
sound, but it does not last either. It is the same with the world of
smell, the world of flavour, the world of tangible object and the world
of objects experienced through the mind-door. However, we usually know
only the world of concepts, because ignorance and wrong view have been
accumulated for so long. Ignorance of paramattha dhammas is the kind of
ignorance which should be eradicated; it brings sorrow. Ignorance
conditions the wrong view of self and all other defilements. So long as
there is ignorance we are deluding ourselves, we do not know what our
life really is: conditioned phenomena which arise and fall away.

The world in the sense of paramattha dhammas is in the teachings called
“the world in the ariyan sense”. The ariyan has developed the wisdom
which sees things as they are; he truly knows “the world”. We read in
the Kindred Sayings (IV, Saḷāyatana-vagga, Kindred Sayings on Sense,
Second Fifty, chapter IV, paragraph 84, Transitory) that Ānanda said to
the Buddha:

> “ ‘The world! The world!’ is the saying lord. Pray, how far, lord,
> does this saying go?”
>
> “What is transitory by nature, Ānanda, is called ‘the world’ in the
> ariyan sense. And what, Ānanda, is transitory by nature? The eye,
> Ānanda, is transitory by nature ...objects ...tongue ...mind [(22)](#FOOT22) is
> transitory by nature, mind-states, mind-consciousness, mind-contact,
> whatsoever pleasant feeling, unpleasant feeling or indifferent feeling
> which arises owing to mind-contact, that also is transitory by nature.
> What is thus transitory, Ānanda, is called ‘the world’ in the ariyan
> sense.”

Someone may think that he can truly know himself without knowing the
world as it appears through the six doors. He may think that he knows
his anger and attachment, but, in fact, he has not experienced them as
they are: only different types of nāma and not self. So long as he has
wrong view of realities he does not really know himself and he cannot
eradicate defilements. He clings to an idea, to the concept of self; he
has not directly experienced any characteristic of reality. It is
difficult to know when there are lobha, dosa and moha, and it is
difficult to be aware also of the more subtle degrees of akusala. When
we start to develop “insight”, right understanding of realities, we
realize how little we know ourselves.

When there is moha we live in darkness. It was the Buddha’s great
compassion which moved him to teach people Dhamma. Dhamma is the light
which can dispel darkness. If we do not know Dhamma we are ignorant of
the world, of ourselves; we are ignorant of good and ill deeds and their
results; we are ignorant of the way to eradicate defilements.

The study of the Abhidhamma will help us to have more understanding of
the characteristic of moha. The Atthasālinī (Book II, Part IX, chapter
I, 249) states about moha:

> “Delusion” (moha) has the characteristic of blindness or opposition to
> knowledge; the essence of non-penetration, or the function of covering
> the intrinsic nature of the object; the manifestation of being opposed
> to right conduct or causing blindness; the proximate cause of unwise
> attention; and it should be regarded as the root of all akusala...

There are many degrees of moha. When we study Dhamma we become less
ignorant of realities; we will have more understanding of paramattha
dhammas, of kamma and vipāka. However, this does not mean that we can
already eradicate moha. Moha cannot be eradicated merely by thinking of
the truth; it can only be eradicated by developing the wisdom which
knows “the world in the ariyan sense”: eyesense, visible object,
seeing-consciousness, earsense, sound, hearing-consciousness, and all
realities appearing through the six doors.

When we study the Abhidhamma we learn that moha arises with all akusala
cittas. Lobha-mūla-cittas have moha and lobha as roots; dosa-mūla-cittas
have moha and dosa as roots. There are two types of akusala citta which
have moha as their only root, these are moha-mūla-cittas. One type of
moha-mūla-citta is moha-mūla-citta accompanied by doubt (in Pāli:
*vicikicchā*), and one type is moha-mūla-citta accompanied by
restlessness (in Pāli: uddhacca). The feeling which accompanies
moha-mūla-cittas is always indifferent feeling (upekkhā). When the citta
is moha-mūla-citta there is no like or dislike; one does not have
pleasant or unpleasant feeling. Both types of moha-mūla-citta are
unprompted (asaṅkhārika).

The characteristic of moha should not be confused with the
characteristic of diṭṭhi (wrong view), which only arises with
lobha-mūla-cittas. When diṭṭhi arises one takes, for example, what is
impermanent for permanent, or one believes that there is a self. Moha is
not wrong view, it is ignorance of realities. Moha conditions diṭṭhi,
but the characteristic of moha is different from the characteristic of
diṭṭhi.

The two types of moha-mūla-citta are:

1. Arising with indifferent feeling, accompanied by doubt
 (Upekkhā-sahagataṃ, vicikicchā-sampayuttaṃ).
2. Arising with indifferent feeling, accompanied by restlessness
 (Upekkhā-sahagataṃ, uddhacca-sampayuttaṃ).

When we have the type of moha-mūla-citta which is accompanied by doubt,
we doubt about the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha [(23)](#FOOT23). We
may doubt whether the Buddha really discovered the truth, whether he
taught the Path leading to the end of defilements, whether there are
other people who can become enlightened as well. We may doubt about past
and future lives, about kamma and vipāka. There are many degrees of
doubt. When we start to develop insight we may have doubt about the
reality of the present moment; we may doubt whether it is nāma or rūpa.
For example, when there is hearing, there is sound as well, but there
can be awareness of only one reality at a time, since only one object at
a time can be experienced by citta. We may doubt whether the reality
which appears at the present moment is the nāma which hears or the rūpa
which is sound. Nāma and rūpa arise and fall away so rapidly and when a
precise understanding of their different characteristics has not been
developed one does not know which reality appears at the present moment.
There will be doubt about the world of paramattha dhammas until paññā
(wisdom) clearly knows the characteristics of nāma and rūpa as they
appear through the six doors.

The Atthasālinī (Book II, Part IX, chapter III, 259) states about doubt:

> Here doubt means exclusion from the cure (of knowledge). Or, one
> investigating the intrinsic nature by means of it suffers pain and
> fatigue (kicchati)-thus it is doubt. It has shifting about as
> characteristic, mental wavering as function, indecision or uncertainty
> in grasp as manifestation, unsystematic thought (unwise attention) as
> proximate cause, and it should be regarded as a danger to attainment.

Doubt is different from wrong view (diṭṭhi). When there is diṭṭhi one
clings, for example, to the view that phenomena are permanent or that
they are self. When vicikicchā, doubt, arises, one wonders whether the
mind is different from the body or not, whether phenomena are permanent
or impermanent. There is no other way to eradicate doubt but the
development of paññā which sees realities as they are. People who have
doubts about the Buddha and his teachings may think that doubt can be
cured by studying historical facts. They want to find out more details
about the time the Buddha lived and about the places where he moved
about; they want to know the exact time the texts were written down.
They cannot be cured of their doubt by studying historical events; this
does not lead to the goal of the Buddha’s teachings which is the
eradication of defilements.

People in the Buddha’s time too were speculating about things which do
not lead to the goal of the teachings. They were wondering whether the
world is finite or infinite, whether the world is eternal or not
eternal, whether the Tathāgata (the Buddha) exists after his final
passing away or not. We read in the Lesser Discourse to Māluṅkyā (Middle
Length Sayings II, no. 63) that Māluṅkyāputta was displeased that the
Buddha did not give explanations with regard to speculative views. He
wanted to question the Buddha on these views and if the Buddha would not
give him an explanation with regard to these views he wanted to leave
the order. He spoke to the Buddha about this matter and the Buddha asked
him whether he had ever said to Māluṅkyāputta:

> “Come you, Māluṅkyāputta, fare the Brahma-faring [(24)](#FOOT24) under
> me and I will explain to you either that the world is eternal or that
> the world is not eternal ...or that the Tathāgata is ...is not after
> dying ...both is and is not after dying... neither is nor is not after
> dying?”

We read that Māluṅkyāputta answered: “No, revered sir.” The Buddha also
asked him whether he (Māluṅkyāputta) had said that he would “fare the
Brahma-faring” under the Lord if the Lord would give him an explanation
with regard to these views and again Māluṅkyāputta answered: “No,
revered sir.” The Buddha then compared his situation with the case of a
man who is pierced by a poisoned arrow and who will not draw out the
arrow until he knows whether the man who pierced him is a noble, a
brahman, a merchant or a worker; until he knows the name of the man and
his clan; until he knows his outward appearance; until he knows about
the bow, the bowstring, the material of the shaft, the kind of arrow.
However, he will pass away before he knows all this. It is the same with
the person who only wants to “fare the Brahma-faring” under the Lord if
explanations with regard to speculative views are given to him. We read
that the Buddha said:

> The living of the Brahma-faring, Māluṅkyāputta, could not be said to
> depend on the view that the world is eternal. Nor could the living of
> the Brahma-faring, Māluṅkyāputta, be said to depend on the view that
> the world is not eternal. Whether there is the view that the world is
> eternal or whether there is the view that the world is not eternal,
> there is birth, there is ageing, there is dying, there are grief,
> sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair, the destruction of which I
> lay down here and now...
>
> Wherefore, Māluṅkyāputta, understand as not explained what has not
> been explained by me, and understand as explained what has been
> explained by me. And what, Māluṅkyāputta, has not been explained by
> me? That the world is eternal ...that the world is not eternal has not
> been explained by me ...And why, Māluṅkyāputta, has this not been
> explained by me? It is because it is not connected with the goal, it
> is not fundamental to the Brahma-faring, and does not conduce to
> turning away from, nor to dispassion, stopping, calming,
> superknowledge, awakening, nor to nibbāna. Therefore it has not been
> explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta. And what has been explained by me,
> Māluṅkyāputta? “This is dukkha” has been explained by me,
> Māluṅkyāputta. “This is the arising of dukkha” has been explained by
> me. “This is the stopping of dukkha” has been explained by me. “This
> is the course leading to the stopping of dukkha” has been explained by
> me. And why, Māluṅkyāputta, has this been explained by me? It is
> because it is connected with the goal, it is fundamental to the
> Brahma-faring, and conduces to turning away from, to dispassion,
> stopping, calming, super-knowledge, awakening and nibbāna...

Doubt cannot be cured by speculating about matters which do not lead to
the goal; it can only be cured by being aware of the nāma and rūpa which
present themselves now. Even when there is doubt, this can be realized
as only a type of nāma which arises because of conditions and which is
not self. Thus the reality of the present moment will be known more
clearly.

The second type of moha-mūla-citta is accompanied by indifferent
feeling, arising with restlessness (upekkhā-sahagataṃ,
uddhacca-sampayuttaṃ). *Uddhacca* is translated as restlessness or
excitement. Uddhacca arises with all akusala cittas. When there is
uddhacca there is no sati (mindfulness) with the citta. Sati arises with
each wholesome citta; it is mindful, non-forgetful, of what is
wholesome. There is sati not only in vipassanā, the development of right
understanding of realities, but also with each kind of kusala. There is
sati when one performs dāna (generosity), observes sīla (good moral
conduct) or applies oneself to bhāvanā, mental development, which
comprises studying or teaching the Dhamma, the development of samatha,
tranquil meditation, and vipassanā. Sati in vipassanā is aware of a
characteristic of nāma or rūpa.

When there is uddhacca, the citta cannot be wholesome; one cannot at
that moment apply oneself to dāna, sīla or bhāvanā. Uddhacca distracts
the citta from kusala. Uddhacca is restlessness with regard to kusala.
Thus, uddhacca is different from what we in conventional language mean
by restlessness.

Uddhacca arises also with the moha-mūla-citta which is accompanied by
doubt, since it arises with each akusala citta. The second type of
moha-mūla-citta, however, is called uddhacca-sampayutta; it is different
from the first type of moha-mūla-citta which is called
vicikicchā-sampayutta.

The second type of moha-mūla-citta, the moha-mūla-citta which is
uddhacca-sampayutta, accompanied by restlessness, arises countless times
a day, but it is difficult to know its characteristic. If one has not
developed vipassanā one does not know this type of citta. When we are
forgetful of realities and “day-dreaming”, there is not necessarily this
type of citta. When we are “day-dreaming”there is not only the second
type of moha-mūla-citta (uddhacca-sampayutta), but also
lobha-mūla-cittas (cittas rooted in attachment) and dosa-mūla-cittas
(cittas rooted in aversion) may arise.

Moha-mūla-citta can arise on account of what we experience through the
five sense-doors and through the mind-door. When, for example, we have
heard sound, moha-mūla-citta may arise. When the second type of
moha-mūla-citta which is uddhacca-sampayutta arises, there is ignorance
and forgetfulness with regard to the object which is experienced at that
moment. We may not see the danger of this type of citta since it is
accompanied by indifferent feeling and thus less obvious. However, all
kinds of akusala are dangerous.

Moha is dangerous, it is the root of all akusala. When we are ignorant
of realities, we accumulate a great deal of akusala. Moha conditions
lobha; when we do not know realities as they are we become absorbed in
the things we experience through the senses. Moha also conditions dosa;
when we are ignorant of realities we have aversion towards unpleasant
experiences. Moha accompanies each akusala citta and it conditions all
ten kinds of akusala kamma patha (killing, stealing, lying etc.) which
are accomplished through body, speech and mind [(25)](#FOOT25). Only
when there is mindfulness of the realities which appear through the six
doors, the wisdom is developed which can eradicate moha.

The sotāpanna (the “streamwinner”, who has attained the first stage of
enlightenment) has eradicated the moha-mūla-citta which is accompanied
by doubt, vicikicchā; he has no more doubts about paramattha dhammas, he
knows the “world in the ariyan sense”. He has no doubts about the
Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. He has no doubts about the Path
leading to the end of defilements. The sotāpanna, the sakadāgāmī (the
“once-returner, who has attained the second stage of enlightenment) and
the anāgāmī (the “non-returner”, who has attained the third stage of
enlightenment) still have the type of moha-mūla-citta accompanied by
uddhacca, restlessness. Only the arahat has eradicated all akusala.

Ignorance is not seeing the true characteristics of realities, not
knowing the four noble Truths. Out of ignorance one does not see the
first noble Truth, the Truth of dukkha: one does not realize the nāma
and rūpa which appear as impermanent and therefore one does not see them
as dukkha, unsatisfactory. One does not know the second noble Truth: the
origin of dukkha which is craving. Because of clinging to nāma and rūpa
there is no end to the cycle of birth and death and thus there is no end
to dukkha. One does not know the noble truth of the cessation of dukkha,
which is nibbāna. One does not know the noble Truth of the way leading
to the cessation of dukkha, which is the eightfold Path. The eightfold
Path is developed through vipassanā.

We read in the Kindred Sayings (IV, Saḷāyatana-vagga, Kindred Sayings
about Jambukhādaka, paragraph 9) that Jambukhādaka asked Sāriputta:

> “ ‘Ignorance, ignorance!’ is the saying, friend Sāriputta. Pray, what
> is ignorance?”
>
> “Not understanding about dukkha, friend, not understanding about the
> arising of dukkha, the ceasing of dukkha, the way leading to the
> ceasing of dukkha - this, friend, is called ‘ignorance’.”
>
> “But is there any way, friend, any approach to the abandoning of this
> ignorance?”
>
> “There is indeed a way, friend, to such abandoning.”
>
> “And what, friend, is that way, that approach to the abandoning of
> this ignorance?”
>
> “It is this ariyan eightfold Path, friend...”

The ariyan eightfold Path leads to the eradication of moha.
