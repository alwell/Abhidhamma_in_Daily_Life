Enlightenment 
=============

One cannot attain enlightenment without having cultivated the right
conditions. We read in the Kindred Sayings (V, Mahā-vagga, Book XI,
Kindred Sayings on Streamwinning, chapter I, paragraph 5, Sāriputta)
about four conditions for becoming a sotāpanna (streamwinner). The sutta
states:

> Now the venerable Sāriputta went to see the Exalted One, and on coming
> to him saluted him and sat down at one side. To the venerable
> Sāriputta so seated the Exalted One said this:
>
> “ ‘A limb of stream-winning! A limb of stream-winning!’ is the saying,
> Sāriputta. Tell me, Sāriputta, of what sort is a limb of
> stream-winning.”
>
> “Lord, association with the upright is a limb of stream-winning.
> Hearing the good Dhamma is a limb of stream-winning. Applying the mind
> is a limb of stream-winning. Conforming to the Dhamma is a limb of
> stream-winning.”
>
> “Well said, Sāriputta! Well said, Sāriputta! Indeed these are limbs of
> stream-winning.
>
> Now again, Sāriputta, they say: ‘The stream! The stream!’ Of what sort
> is the stream, Sāriputta?”
>
> “The stream, lord, is just this ariyan eightfold way, to wit: Right
> view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood,
> right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.”
>
> “Well said, Sāriputta! Well said, Sāriputta! The stream is just this
> ariyan eightfold way.
>
> Now again, Sāriputta, they say, ‘Streamwinner! Streamwinner!’ Of what
> sort is a streamwinner, Sāriputta?”
>
> “Whosoever, lord, is blessed with this ariyan eightfold way - such an
> one of such a name, of such and such a clan, is called
>
> ‘Streamwinner’.”

The first condition, association with the righteous person, is most
important. It would not be possible to find the right path by oneself.
Only Buddhas have accumulated such wisdom that they can find the Path by
themselves, without the help of a teacher. Other people, however, need
the teachings of a Buddha in order to find the right path, because
ignorance has been accumulated for an endlessly long time. We need
association with the right person, the good friend in Dhamma, who can
point out to us the right path, because our defilements prevent us from
finding the right path. Our friend in Dhamma can encourage us to develop
right understanding of nāma and rūpa.

The question may arise what one should do if one is not able to find the
right friend in Dhamma. Is reading the scriptures not a condition to
find the path leading to enlightenment? It is true that reading the
scriptures is also very helpful since they can encourage us to be
mindful of nāma and rūpa in daily life. We might, however, interpret the
teachings in the wrong way. It depends on conditions whether we come
into contact with the right person who can help us to understand the
teachings as well as the practice in accordance with the teachings.
Accumulated kusala kamma can be the condition for us to meet the right
person.

When we have heard the Dhamma from the right person, we should “apply
the mind”; this is the third condition. We should not blindly follow the
person who teaches us Dhamma, but we should investigate the scriptures
ourselves, ponder over the Dhamma, and consider it carefully, in order
to test the truth.

The real test of the truth is the practice itself. Therefore, the fourth
condition is “conforming to the Dhamma”, which is the development of the
eightfold Path. By being mindful of the phenomena appearing through the
six doors we can find out ourselves whether it is true that these
phenomena are only nāma and rūpa, arising because of conditions. We can
investigate ourselves whether they are impermanent or permanent, whether
they are dukkha or happiness, whether they are non-self, anattā, or
“self”. We can find out through the practice itself whether we really
understand the teachings. If we practise in the wrong way we may
eventually find out that this does not lead to right understanding of
the realities of our daily life. Through the development of the
eightfold Path we will have more confidence (saddhā) in the Buddha’s
teachings. We will have more confidence when we experience that through
right understanding of nāma and rūpa in daily life there will be less
clinging to “self”.

Lokuttara cittas cannot arise without the cultivation of the right
conditions. Some people wish for an end to dukkha but they do not
develop understanding in daily life. They hope that one day lokuttara
cittas will arise. The Buddha pointed out that the realization of the
four noble Truths is difficult, and he said this, not in order to
discourage people, but in order to remind them not to be heedless.

We read in the Kindred Sayings (V, Mahā-vagga, Book XII, Kindred Sayings
about the Truths, chapter V, paragraph 5, The keyhole) that, when the
Buddha was staying at Vesālī in Great Grove, Ānanda went into Vesālī on
his rounds for almsfood. In Vesālī he saw the Licchavi youths practising
archery. He then went to see the Buddha and said:

> “Here, lord, robing myself in the forenoon and taking bowl and outer
> robe I set out for Vesālī on my begging rounds. Then, lord, I saw a
> number of Licchavi youths in the gymnasium making practice at archery,
> shooting even from a distance through a very small keyhole, and
> splitting an arrow, shot after shot, with never a miss. And I said to
> myself, lord: ‘Practised shots are these Licchavi youths! Well
> practised shots indeed are these Licchavi youths, to be able even at a
> distance to splinter an arrow through a very small keyhole, shot after
> shot, with never a miss!’ ”
>
> “Now what think you, Ānanda? Which is the harder, which is the harder
> task to compass: To shoot like that or to pierce one strand of hair,
> seven times divided, with another strand?”
>
> “Why, lord, of course to split a hair in such a way is the harder,
> much the harder task.”
>
> “Just so, Ānanda, they who penetrate the meaning of: This is dukkha,
> this is the arising of dukkha, this is the ceasing of dukkha, this is
> the practice that leads to the ceasing of dukkha, pierce through
> something much harder to pierce.
>
> Wherefore, Ānanda, you must make an effort to realize: This is dukkha.
> This is the arising of dukkha. This is the ceasing of dukkha. This is
> the practice that leads to the ceasing of dukkha.”

One might feel discouraged when reading this sutta; it would seem that
it is impossible to attain enlightenment. However, if one develops the
right Path, not the wrong Path, one will realize the four noble Truths;
one will attain enlightenment. The way to realize the four noble Truths
is to be mindful of the realities which appear now: seeing, visible
object, lobha, dosa or any other reality. We should not be discouraged
when we do not seem to make rapid progress. Most people cling to a
result and they become impatient when they do not notice an immediate
result; clinging to a result, however, is not helpful for the
development of wisdom, it is akusala.

Some people feel that the development of samatha can give a more
immediate result. Samatha, when it has been developed in the right way,
has tranquillity as its result. When jhāna is attained, lobha, dosa and
moha are temporarily eliminated. However, the attainment of jhāna is
extremely difficult and many conditions have to be cultivated. When one
is developing samatha, the hindrances may still arise: there will be
sensuous desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor, restlessness, worry and
doubt, until “access-concentration” or jhāna has been attained.

The aim of vipassanā is not tranquillity, but the eradication of wrong
view and eventually of all defilements. This goal may seem far off, but
each short moment of right awareness of nāma and rūpa is very fruitful;
it will help to eliminate clinging to the concept of self. While one is
mindful, there are no lobha, dosa or moha. Although tranquillity is not
the aim of vipassanā, at the moment of right mindfulness there is kusala
citta, and kusala citta is accompanied by calm.

Vipassanā or insight is the development of right understanding of all
nāmas and rūpas which present themselves in daily life. Insight is
developed in different stages and in the course of its development the
characteristics of nāma and rūpa will be understood more clearly, and
their arising and falling away will be known through direct experience.
When insight has been developed stage by stage, the nāma and rūpa which
present themselves through the six doors can be clearly seen as
impermanent, dukkha and non-self, anattā. When paññā has been developed
to the degree that enlightenment can be attained, the unconditioned
reality, nibbāna, is directly experienced. The direct experience of
nibbāna is different from thinking about nibbāna. Nibbāna is directly
experienced during a mind-door process of cittas. Nibbāna cannot be
experienced through any of the five senses, it can be experienced only
through the mind-door.

In the process during which enlightenment is attained, the
manodvārāvajjana-citta (the mind-door-adverting-consciousness) takes as
its object one of the three characteristics of reality: impermanence,
dukkha or anattā. This means that the reality presenting itself at that
moment is seen either as impermanent, or as dukkha or as anattā. Anicca,
dukkha and anattā are three aspects of the truth of conditioned
realities. Thus, if one sees one aspect, one also sees the other
aspects. However, the three characteristics cannot be experienced at the
same time, since citta can experience only one object at a time. It
depends on one’s accumulations which of the three characteristics is
realized in the process of cittas during which enlightenment is
attained: one person views the reality appearing at that moment as
impermanent, another as dukkha, and another again as non-self, anattā.
The mano-dvārāvajjana-citta, mind-door-adverting-consciousness, of that
process adverts to one of these three characteristics and is then
succeeded by three or four cittas which are not yet lokuttara cittas,
but mahā-kusala cittas (kusala cittas of the sense-sphere) accompanied
by paññā [(110)](#FOOT110). The first mahā-kusala citta, which is called
parikamma or preparatory consciousness, still has the same object as the
mano-dvārāvajjana-citta. Whichever of the three characteristics of
conditioned realities the mano-dvārāvajjana-citta adverted to, the
parikamma realizes that characteristic. The parikamma is succeeded by
the upacāra or proximity consciousness which still has the same object
as the mano-dvārāvajjana citta. This citta, the second mahā-kusala citta
in that process, is nearer to the moment the lokuttara cittas will
arise. The upacāra is succeeded by the anuloma, which means conformity
or adaptation. This citta still has the same object as the
mano-dvārāvajjana-citta. Anuloma is succeeded by gotrabhū which is
sometimes translated as change of lineage. This citta is the last
kāmāvacara citta in that process. Gotrabhū is the last kāmāvacara citta
in a process before a citta of another plane of consciousness arises.
The other plane of consciousness may be rūpāvacara, arūpāvacara or
lokuttara. In samatha, gotrabhū is the last kāmāvacara citta before the
rūpa-jhānacitta or the arūpa-jhānacitta arises. In vipassanā, gotrabhū
is the last kāmāvacara citta of the non-ariyan before the lokuttara
citta arises and he becomes an ariyan. The object of the gotrabhū
arising before the lokuttara cittas is different from the object of
gotrabhū in samatha; the gotrabhū preceding the lokuttara cittas
experiences nibbāna. It is the first citta in that process which
experiences nibbāna, but it is not lokuttara citta. At the moment of
gotrabhū the person who is about to attain enlightenment is still a
non-ariyan. Gotrabhū does not eradicate defilements. Gotrabhū is
succeeded by the magga-citta which eradicates the defilements that are
to be eradicated at the stage of the sotāpanna. The magga-citta is the
first lokuttara citta in that process of cittas. When it has fallen away
it is succeeded by two (or three) phala-cittas (fruition-consciousness)
which are the result of the magga-citta and which still have nibbāna as
the object. As we have seen, the magga-citta is succeeded immediately by
its result, in the same process of citta [(111)](#FOOT111). The
magga-citta cannot produce vipāka in the form of rebirth, such as the
kusala citta of the other planes of consciousness. The phala-cittas are
succeeded by bhavanga-cittas [(112)](#FOOT112).

Some people do not need the moment of parikamma (preparatory
consciousness) and in that case three moments of phala-citta arise
instead of two moments.

Summarising the cittas in the process during which enlightenment is
attained, they are the following:

- mano-dvārāvajjana-citta
- parikamma (preparatory consciousness; for some people not necessary)
- upacāra (proximity consciousness)
- anuloma (conformity or adaptation)
- gotrabhū (change of lineage)
- magga-citta
- phala-citta (two or three moments, depending on the individual)

Nibbāna can be the object of kāmāvacara cittas which arise after the
lokuttara cittas have fallen away. Before someone becomes an ariyan
there can only be speculation about nibbāna. For the ariyan, however, it
is different. Since he has directly experienced nibbāna, he can review
his experience afterwards. We read in the Visuddhimagga (XXII, 19) that
the person who attained enlightenment reviews, after the lokuttara
cittas have fallen away, the path, the fruition, the defilements which
have been abandoned, the defilements which are still remaining and
nibbāna. He reviews these things in different mind-door processes of
citta.

Some people think that enlightenment could not occur in daily life, they
believe that it is necessary to be in a solitary place in order to
attain nibbāna. The development of vipassanā is the development of right
understanding of all realities occurring in daily life. When paññā has
been developed to the degree that enlightenment can be attained,
enlightenment can occur in the middle of one’s daily activities. As we
have seen, the attainment of enlightenment is only a few moments of
citta which arise and fall away within split seconds.

We read in the Discourse to Dīghanakha (Middle Length Sayings II, no.
74) that the Buddha taught Dhamma to the wanderer Dīghanaka on Vulture’s
Peak near Rājagaha. He taught him about the getting rid of wrong views
and about the impermanence of conditioned realities. Sāriputta, who was
an ariyan but had not yet attained arahatship, was also present at the
time of that discourse. We read:

> Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta was standing behind the Lord,
> fanning the Lord. Then it occurred to the venerable Sāriputta:
>
> “The Lord speaks to us of getting rid of these things and those by
> means of super-knowledge, the Well-farer speaks to us of casting out
> these things and those by means of superknowledge”. While the
> venerable Sāriputta was reflecting on this, his mind was freed from
> the cankers without clinging. But to the wanderer Dīghanakha there
> arose the stainless, spotless vision of dhamma, that whatever is of
> the nature to arise all that is of the nature to stop...

Sāriputta attained arahatship, but he did not go into solitude in order
to attain it; he was fanning the Buddha. Dīghanakha listened to the
Buddha and then became a sotāpanna.

We read in the Kindred Sayings (III, Khandhā-vagga, Middle Fifty,
chapter 4, paragraph 89, Khema) that Khemaka, who was an anāgāmī,
attained arahatship while he was preaching and monks who were listening
attained arahatship as well. We read:

> Now when this teaching was thus expounded the hearts of as many as
> sixty monks were utterly set free from the āsavas, and so was it also
> with the heart of the venerable Khemaka...

If one is on the right Path, paññā can be developed, no matter what the
circumstances are, even to the degree of enlightenment. People may
wonder whether it would be possible to notice it when a person attains
nibbāna. But can one see whether someone else is mindful or not mindful?
Who knows the cittas of other people? We cannot know when someone else
is mindful of nāma and rūpa or when he attains nibbāna.

The question may arise whether all four stages of enlightenment (the
stages of the sotāpanna, the sakadāgāmī, the anāgāmī and the arahat) can
be attained in the course of one life. We read in the suttas about
disciples of the Buddha who attained the ariyan state but not yet
arahatship and realized arahatship later on in life. Ānanda, for
example, did not attain arahatship during the Buddha’s life, but he
became an arahat after the Buddha had passed away, the evening before
the first great council was to start (the “Illustrator of Ultimate
meaning”, commentary to the “Mangala-sutta” or “Good Omen Discourse”,
Minor Readings, Khuddaka Nikāya).

The arahat has eradicated all defilements and thus he has reached the
end of the cycle of birth, old age, sickness and death; he has realized
the end of dukkha. The arahat will not be reborn, but he still has to
die and therefore one may ask whether he really has attained the end of
dukkha at the moment he realizes arahatship. Even the arahat is subject
to death, since he was born. He can also experience unpleasant results
of akusala kamma committed before he became an arahat. However, he has
no more defilements and cannot accumulate any more kamma which might
produce vipāka, he is really free from dukkha.

In As it was said (Itivuttaka, The Twos, chapter II, paragraph 7,
Khuddaka Nikāya) two “conditions [(113)](#FOOT113) of nibbāna” are
explained. In this sutta Sa-upādi-sesa-nibbāna [(114)](#FOOT114), one
“condition” of nibbāna, pertains to the arahat who has eradicated all
defilements but for whom the five khandhas are still remaining. For the
arahat who has not finally passed away yet, there are still citta,
cetasika and rūpa arising and falling away. An-upādi-sesa-nibbāna
[(115)](#FOOT115), the other “condition” of nibbāna, pertains to the
arahat who has finally passed away; for him there are no khandhas
remaining, there are no longer citta, cetasika and rūpa arising and
falling away.

We read in the verse of this sutta, after the explanation:


   
 
	 These two nibbāna-states are shown by him 
	 Who sees, who is such and unattached. 
	 One state is that in this same life possessed 
	 With base remaining, though becoming's stream 
	 Be cut off. While the state without a base 
	 Belongs to the future, wherein all 
	 Becomings utterly do come to cease. 
	 They who, by knowing this state uncompounded (116) 
	 Have heart's release, by cutting off the stream, 
	 They who have reached the core of dhamma, glad 
	 To end, such have abandoned all becomings. 
 


When someone has become an arahat there will be no more rebirth for him.
When someone has attained enlightenment to the stage of the sotāpanna,
he has become an ariyan, but he has not reached the end of rebirth. The
sotāpanna will be reborn, but not more than seven times; thus,
eventually there will be an end to rebirth for him. If we do not develop
vipassanā, the number of rebirths will be endless. It was out of
compassion that the Buddha spoke about the dangers of rebirth; he wanted
to encourage people to develop right understanding. We read in the
Kindred Sayings (V, Mahā-vagga, Book XII, Kindred Sayings about the
Truths, chapter V, paragraph 6, Gross darkness) that the Buddha said to
the monks:

> “Monks, there is a darkness of interstellar space, impenetrable gloom,
> such a murk of darkness as cannot enjoy the splendour of this moon and
> sun, though they be of such mighty magic power and majesty.”
>
> At these words a certain monk said to the Exalted One:
>
> “Lord, that must be a mighty darkness, a mighty darkness indeed! Pray,
> lord, is there any other darkness greater and more fearsome than
> that?”
>
> “There is indeed, monk, another darkness, greater and more fearsome.
> And what is that other darkness?
>
> Monk, whatsoever recluses or brahmins understand not, as it really is,
> the meaning of: This is dukkha, this is the arising of dukkha, this is
> the ceasing of dukkha, this is the practice that leads to the ceasing
> of dukkha, such take delight in the activities which conduce to
> rebirth. Thus taking delight they compose a compound of activities
> which conduce to rebirth. Thus composing a compound of activities they
> fall down into the darkness of rebirth, into the darkness of old age
> and death, of sorrow, grief, woe, lamentation and despair. They are
> not released from birth, old age and death, from sorrow, grief, woe,
> lamentation and despair. They are not released from dukkha, I declare.
>
> But, monk, those recluses or brahmins who do understand as it really
> is, the meaning of: This is dukkha, this is the arising of dukkha,
> this is the ceasing of dukkha, this is the practice that leads to the
> ceasing of dukkha, such take not delight in the activities which

>
> Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize: This is dukkha.
> This is the arising of dukkha. This is the ceasing of dukkha. This is
> the practice that leads to the ceasing of dukkha.”
