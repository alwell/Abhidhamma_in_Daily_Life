The Sobhana Cittas in our Life 
==============================

There are many different types of citta which arise in our life and they
can be classified in different ways. When they are classified by way of
four “jātis” (jāti means “birth” or “nature”), they are:

1. Kusala cittas (wholesome cittas)
2. Akusala cittas (unwholesome cittas)
3. Vipākacittas (cittas which are result)
4. Kiriyacittas (cittas which are “inoperative”, neither cause nor
 result)

Another way of classifying cittas is as follows:

1. Sobhana cittas, cittas accompanied by sobhana (beautiful ) cetasikas
2. Asobhana cittas, cittas unaccompanied by sobhana cetasikas.

Akusala cittas and ahetuka cittas are asobhana cittas, they are not
accompanied by sobhana cetasikas. As we have seen, there are twelve
types of akusala cittas. They are:

- 8 types of lobha-mūla-citta (cittas rooted in attachment)
- 2 types of dosa-mūla-citta (cittas rooted in aversion)
- 2 types of moha-mūla-citta (cittas rooted in ignorance)

Ahetuka cittas are cittas without roots and unaccompanied by sobhana
cetasikas, and thus they are asobhana. As we have seen, there are
eighteen types of ahetuka cittas. Summarising them, they are:

- 10 dvi-pañca-viññāṇas, which are ahetuka vipākacittas (the five
 pairs of seeing, hearing, etc.)
- 2 sampaṭicchana-cittas, receiving-consciousness, which are ahetuka
 vipāka cittas (one akusala vipāka and one kusala vipāka)
- 3 santīraṇa-cittas, investigating-consciousness, which are ahetuka
 vipāka cittas (one akusala vipāka, one kusala vipāka, accompanied by
 upekkhā, and one kusala vipāka, accompanied by somanassa)
- 1 pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta, five-door-adverting-consciousness, which
 is ahetuka kiriyacitta
- 1 mano-dvārāvajjana-citta, mind-door-adverting-consciousness, which
 is ahetuka kiriyacitta
- 1 hasituppāda-citta, an ahetuka kiriyacitta which can produce the
 smile of an arahat

Thus, there are thirty asobhana cittas: twelve akusala cittas and
eighteen ahetuka cittas.

There are also sobhana cittas arising in our life, cittas which are
accompanied by sobhana cetasikas. Three among the sobhana cetasikas are
hetu, root. They are: alobha (non-attachment), adosa (non-aversion) and
amoha or paññā, wisdom. Sobhana cittas are always accompanied by the two
sobhana hetus of alobha and adosa and they may or may not be accompanied
by paññā. Thus, sobhana cittas are sahetuka, accompanied by hetus. When
we perform dāna (generosity), observe sīla (morality) or apply ourselves
to bhāvanā (which comprises samatha, vipassanā and the study or teaching
of Dhamma), there are kusala cittas, accompanied by sobhana cetasikas.
Thus, kusala cittas are among the sobhana cittas.

The kusala cittas which perform dāna, observe sīla or apply themselves
to bhāvanā are cittas belonging to the lowest plane of consciousness,
the “sense sphere”; they are kāmāvacara cittas. Kāmāvacara cittas are
the cittas we have in daily life, when, for example, we are seeing,
thinking or wishing for something. Sometimes kāmāvacara cittas arise
with sobhana hetus (beautiful roots), sometimes with akusala hetus, and
sometimes without any hetus. Dāna, sīla and bhāvanā is performed by
kāmāvacara kusala cittas; these kinds of kusala kamma can be performed
in daily life, where there are sense-impressions. Kāmāvacara kusala
cittas are called mahā-kusala cittas (“mahā” means “many” or “great”).

For those who attain jhāna (absorption, developed in samatha, tranquil
meditation) there is at that moment no seeing, hearing or any other
sense-impression; then the citta is not kāmāvacara citta, but it is of a
higher plane of consciousness. The jhānacittas can be rūpāvacara cittas
(rūpa-jhānacittas) or arūpāvacara cittas (arūpa jhānacittas). However,
while one is developing samatha the cittas are mahā-kusala cittas before
one attains jhāna.

When enlightenment is attained and the citta experiences nibbāna, the
citta is of the lokuttara bhūmi, the “supramundane” plane of
consciousness (bhūmi is plane). However, lokuttara kusala cittas,
magga-cittas, are preceded by mahā-kusala cittas in the process of
cittas during which enlightenment is attained.

We would like to have kusala cittas more often. We may think that the
circumstances of our life or other people hinder the arising of kusala
citta, but this is not so. The real cause that kusala cittas seldom
arise is our lack of development of what is wholesome. If we know the
conditions for the development of kusala, there will be more kusala
cittas in our life. Through the study of the Dhamma we will learn how to
develop kusala. If we have not studied Dhamma we may think that we are
performing kusala while we have, on the contrary, akusala cittas. For
example, we may think that when we give something away, there are only
kusala cittas. However, lobha-mūla-cittas may also arise. We may give
something to friends and expect them to be kind to us in return. This is
not kusala but lobha, attachment. When we study Dhamma we learn that the
pure way of giving is giving without expecting anything in return. When
we perform wholesome deeds our aim should be to have less selfishness,
and this is beneficial both for ourselves and for others.

People have different accumulations and these are conditions for the
arising of kusala cittas and akusala cittas. For example, when people
visit a temple and see others presenting gifts to the monks, they may,
because of their accumulations, react in different ways. Some people may
appreciate someone else’s good deeds; others may not be interested at
all. If one would know the value of kusala and realize that appreciating
the good deeds of others is a way of dāna, one would use more
opportunities to develop kusala.

If the Buddha had not attained enlightenment and taught Dhamma we would
not have any means of knowing ourselves thoroughly; we would not have a
precise knowledge of our kusala cittas and akusala cittas and of the
conditions for their arising. The Buddha taught people how to develop
wholesomeness and eradicate defilements, and therefore, living according
to the precepts and performing other kinds of wholesomeness is the way
to pay respect to him. We read in the Mahā-Parinibbāna-sutta (Dialogues
of the Buddha II, no. 16, chapter V, 137,138) that before the Buddha
passed away, the twin Sāla trees, which were full of flowers although it
was not the season, dropped their flowers all over his body, that
heavenly Mandārava-flowers and sandalwood-powder descended on his body,
and that heavenly music sounded, out of reverence for him. The Buddha
said to Ānanda:

> Now it is not thus, Ānanda, that the Tathāgata is rightly honoured,
> reverenced, venerated, held sacred or revered. But the monk or the
> nun, the devout man or the devout woman, who continually fulfils all
> the greater and lesser duties, who is correct in life, walking
> according to the precepts -it is he who rightly honours, reverences,
> venerates, holds sacred, and reveres the Tathāgata with the worthiest
> homage. Therefore, O Ānanda, be constant in the fulfilment of the
> greater and of the lesser duties, and be correct in life, walking
> according to the precepts; and thus, Ānanda, should it be taught.

We all have in our daily life opportunities for dāna and sīla. As
regards bhāvanā, this comprises samatha and vipassanā, and the studying
of Dhamma or explaining it to others. Not only the monks but also
laypeople can study and teach Dhamma. We read in the
Mahā-Parinibbāna-sutta (chapter III, 112, 113) that the Buddha told
Ānanda that Māra, the Evil One, had said to the Buddha after his
enlightenment that it was now the time for him to pass away. The Buddha
said:

> And when he had thus spoken, Ānanda, I addressed Māra, the Evil One,
> and said:- “I shall not pass away, O Evil One! Until not only the
> monks and nuns of the Order, but also the laydisciples of either sex
> shall have become true hearers, wise and well trained, ready and
> learned, carrying the teachings in their memory, masters of the lesser
> corollaries that follow from the larger doctrine, correct in life,
> walking according to the precepts-until they, having thus themselves
> learned the doctrine, shall be able to tell others of it, preach it,
> make it known, establish it, open it, minutely explain it and make it
> clear-until they, when others start vain doctrine easy to be refuted
> by the truth, shall be able in refuting it to spread the
> wonder-working truth abroad! I shall not die until this pure religion
> of mine shall have become successful, prosperous, widespread, and
> popular in all its full extent-until, in a word, it shall have been
> well proclaimed among men!”

The fact that we are able to perform wholesome deeds in our lives is due
to conditions, it is not due to a self. We read in the Dialogues of the
Buddha (III, no. 34, Tenfold Series, chapter IV, 276) about factors
which are helpful conditions for kusala:

> Four ...that help much:-four “wheels” [(82)](#FOOT82), to wit, the orbit
> of a favourable place of residence, the orbit of association with the
> good, perfect adjustment of oneself, the cycle of merit wrought in the
> past.

As regards a favourable place of residence, living in a Buddhist country
can be a helpful condition for kusala cittas. Then one has the
opportunity to visit temples and listen to the preaching of Dhamma. The
Dhamma can change our life, it is the condition for the performing of
wholesome deeds, for dāna, sīla and bhāvanā.

As regards association with the good, this means association with the
right friend in Dhamma. If one, even though living in a Buddhist
country, does not meet the right friend in Dhamma who can help in the
search for the truth, one lacks the condition which is most helpful for
the development of wisdom and the eradication of defilements.

Perfect adjustment of oneself is “adjusting oneself” with kusala,
becoming established in good qualities. There are many degrees of
kusala. If one develops the wisdom of the eightfold Path in being
mindful of nāma and rūpa, there will be less clinging to the concept of
self. If there is mindfulness of nāma and rūpa while performing
wholesome deeds, one will come to realize that no self, no person
performs these deeds. In that way kusala kamma will be purer and
eventually defilements will be eradicated.

The accumulation of kusala in the past is the fourth factor which is
helpful. The kusala kammas which were accumulated in the past are the
condition for us to go to the right place and meet the right people. It
is kamma which causes one to be born in a Buddhist country or to live in
a Buddhist country. The kusala accumulated in the past conditions our
study and practice of the Dhamma at the present time. If we consider the
factors in our life which are the conditions for kusala we will
understand more clearly that it is not self who performs good deeds.

In the Abhidhamma we learn that there are eight types of mahā-kusala
cittas, kusala cittas of the sensuous plane of consciousness. Why isn’t
there only one type? The reason is that each type has its own conditions
for its arising. If we know about these different types and if we can be
aware of them when their characteristics present themselves, it will
help us not to take them for self. Four types of mahā-kusala cittas
arise with somanassa (pleasant feeling) and four types arise with
upekkhā (indifferent feeling). We would like to have kusala cittas with
somanassa, because we cling to somanassa. However, we cannot force
somanassa to arise. Sometimes we perform dāna with somanassa, sometimes
with upekkhā. It depends on conditions whether somanassa or whether
upekkhā arises with the mahā-kusala citta. Four types are accompanied by
wisdom; four types are not accompanied by wisdom. We may, for example,
help others without paññā or with paññā. When we realize that helping is
kusala, or when we are aware of the nāma or rūpa appearing at that
moment, there is paññā arising with the mahā-kusala citta. Four types
are asaṅkhārika (unprompted, spontaneous, not induced by someone else or
by one’s own consideration) and four types are sasaṅkhārika (prompted,
by someone else or by oneself). The eight types of mahā-kusala cittas
are the following:

1. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wisdom, unprompted
 (Somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ)
2. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wisdom, prompted
 (Somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ)
3. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wisdom, unprompted
 (Somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ)
4. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wisdom, prompted
 (Somanassa-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ)
5. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wisdom, unprompted
 (Upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ)
6. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wisdom, prompted
 (Upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ)
7. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wisdom, unprompted
 (Upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ)
8. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wisdom, prompted
 (Upekkhā-sahagataṃ, ñāṇa-vippayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ)

Mahā-kusala cittas are not the only kind of kāmāvacara sobhana cittas
(beautiful cittas of the sensuous plane of consciousness). Mahā-kusala
cittas are cittas which are cause; they can motivate kusala kamma
through body, speech or mind which is capable of producing results.
There are also mahā-vipākacittas, which are results of kusala kamma
performed with mahā-kusala cittas. Mahā-vipākacittas are sobhana cittas
too, arising with sobhana cetasikas. There are several types of
mahā-vipākacittas because the kusala kammas which produce them are of
different kinds.

People’s deeds are not the same and thus the results cannot be the same.
People are born with different paṭisandhi-cittas
(rebirth-consciousness). Paṭisandhi-cittas are vipākacittas; they are
the result of kamma. As we have seen before (in chapter 11), human
beings can be born with a paṭisandhi-citta which is ahetuka kusala
vipāka (and in this case they are handicapped from the first moment of
life), or with a paṭisandhi-citta which is sahetuka vipāka, accompanied
by sobhana hetus. In the case of human beings, and of beings born in
other sensuous planes of existence, the paṭisandhi-citta which is
sahetuka vipākacitta is mahā-vipākacitta, the result of kāmāvacara
kusala kamma (kamma performed by mahā-kusala cittas, kusala cittas of
the sensuous plane of consciousness). Apart from mahā-vipākacitta there
are other types of sahetuka vipākacitta which are not the result of
kāmāvacara kusala kamma but of kusala kamma of higher planes of
consciousness. These types will be dealt with later on.

There are eight types of mahā-vipākacittas. They can be accompanied by
somanassa or by upekkhā, they can be with paññā or without paññā, they
can be unprompted, asaṅkhārika, or prompted, sasaṅkhārika. They are
classified in the same way as the eight types of mahā-kusala cittas
mentioned above.

The bhavanga-citta (life-continuum) and the cuti-citta
(dying-consciousness) are the same type of citta as the first citta in
one’s life, the paṭisandhi-citta. If the paṭisandhi-citta is
mahā-vipākacitta, the bhavanga-citta and the cuti-citta of that life are
the same type of mahā-vipākacitta. In that case the functions of
paṭisandhi, bhavanga and cuti are performed by mahā-vipākacitta.

When we see a beautiful visible object or experience pleasant objects
through the other sense-doors, the citta is kusala vipākacitta, the
result of kusala kamma; however, that kind of vipākacitta is ahetuka
vipāka (arising without hetu), it is not mahā-vipāka. The functions of
seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and experiencing tangible object
through the bodysense, and also the functions of sampaṭicchana,
receiving, and santīraṇa, investigating, cannot be performed by
mahā-vipākacittas, they are performed by ahetuka vipākacittas.
Tadārammaṇa-citta, a vipāka-citta which may arise after the
javana-cittas and which performs the function of tadārammaṇa,
registering or retention, can be ahetuka vipākacitta or mahā-vipākacitta
[(83)](#FOOT83).

There are still other kinds of kāmāvacara sobhana cittas: the
mahā-kiriyacittas [(84)](#FOOT84). The arahat has mahā-kiriyacittas
instead of mahā-kusala cittas. Since he has no conditions for rebirth he
does not accumulate any more kamma. He has mahā-kiriyacittas
(inoperative cittas) which perform the function of javana in the
sense-door process and in the mind-door process. When we experience a
pleasant object lobha may arise and when we experience an unpleasant
object dosa may arise. The arahat has equanimity towards pleasant
objects and unpleasant objects, he has no more defilements. The arahat
can have mahā-kiriyacittas which are ñāṇa-vippayutta, not accompanied by
wisdom. Arahats can have mahā-kiriyacittas which are ñāṇa-vippayutta,
because paññā does not necessarily accompany the mahā-kiriyacittas when
they are not preaching or discussing Dhamma.

The arahat has kiriyacittas which are sobhana cittas and also
kiriyacittas which are asobhana cittas. The five sense-door-adverting
consciousness, pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta, the mind-door-adverting
consciousness, mano-dvārāvajjana-citta, the hasituppāda-citta, smile
producing consciousness of the arahat which can perform the function of
javana, are asobhana kiriyacittas. These types of citta are not
accompanied by sobhana cetasikas, they are ahetuka.

There are eight types of mahā-kiriyacittas in all. They are accompanied
by somanassa or by upekkhā, they are accompanied by paññā or not
accompanied by paññā, they are asaṅkhārika or sasaṅkhārika. They are
classified in the same way as the eight types of mahā-kusala cittas.

Altogether there are fifty-four cittas which are kāma-bhūmi
[(85)](#FOOT85), or kāmāvacara cittas, cittas of the sensuous plane of
consciousness. They are:

30 asobhana cittas

24 sobhana cittas

12 akusala cittas

8 mahā-vipākacittas

18 ahetuka cittas

8 mahā-kusalacittas

8 mahā-kiriyacittas

Thus, there are thirty asobhana cittas and twenty-four kāma-sobhana
cittas (sobhana cittas of the sensuous plane of consciousness).

There are also sobhana cittas which are not kāma-sobhana cittas, namely:

- the sobhana cittas which are rūpa-bhūmi (rūpāvacara cittas, for
 those who attain rūpa-jhāna)
- the sobhana cittas which are arūpa-bhūmi (arūpāvacara cittas, for
 those who attain arūpa-jhāna)
- the sobhana cittas which are lokuttara bhūmi, (lokuttara cittas for
 those who attain enlightenment)

Only kāmāvacara cittas can include both sobhana cittas and asobhana
cittas. Cittas which are rūpa-bhūmi, arūpa-bhūmi and lokuttara bhūmi can
only be sobhana cittas.

Those who do not attain jhāna or attain enlightenment cannot know the
cittas of other bhūmis, but they can verify the truth of the Buddha’s
teachings as regards the kāma-bhūmi, the cittas of the sensuous plane of
consciousness. We can find out for ourselves whether it is beneficial to
perform dāna, observe sīla and apply ourselves to bhāvanā. We can find
out whether the development of these ways of kusala helps us to have
less akusala cittas. Sometimes it is the right moment for dāna,
sometimes for sīla or for bhāvanā. Vipassanā, right understanding of
realities, can be developed at any time, no matter whether we perform
dāna, observe sīla, study or teach Dhamma. Right understanding can also
be developed when there is no opportunity for dāna, sīla or other ways
of kusala. Through mindfulness of nāma and rūpa we come to know the
different types of cittas which arise, also akusala cittas and
eventually there will be less attachment to the concept of self. In
being mindful we can verify the truth of the Buddha’s teachings.

We read in the Gradual Sayings (Book of the Sevens, chapter VIII,
paragraph 9, The message):

> Now the venerable Upāli came to the Exalted One, saluted and sat down
> at one side. So seated, he said: “Well were it for me, lord, if the
> Exalted One were to expound Dhamma briefly to me, so that, having
> heard it, I might abide resolute, alone, secluded, earnest and
> zealous.”
>
> “The doctrines, Upāli, of which you may know: ‘These doctrines lead
> one not to complete weariness (of the world), nor to dispassion, nor
> to ending, nor to calm, nor to knowledge, nor to awakening, nor to the
> cool’-regard them definitely as not Dhamma, not the discipline, not
> the word of the Teacher. But the doctrines of which you may know:
> ‘These doctrines lead one to complete weariness, dispassion, ending,
> calm, knowledge, the awakening, the cool’-regard them unreservedly as
> Dhamma, the discipline, the word of the Teacher.”

The Commentary to this sutta, the “Manorathapūraṇi”, explains the word
“knowledge” as the penetration of the three characteristics of
conditioned realities, namely, impermanence, dukkha and anattā. The
“awakening” refers to the attainment of enlightenment and the “cool” to
nibbāna.
