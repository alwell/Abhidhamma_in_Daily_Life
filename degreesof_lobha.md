Different Degrees of Lobha 
==========================

Lobha, attachment, leads to sorrow. If we really understand this, we
will wish to eradicate lobha. The eradication of lobha, however, cannot
be done immediately. We may be able to suppress lobha for a while, but
it will appear again when there are the right conditions for its
arising. Even though we know that lobha brings sorrow, it is bound to
arise time and again. However, there is a way to eradicate it: it can be
eradicated by the wisdom which sees things as they are.

When we study cittas more in detail it will help us to know ourselves.
We should know not only the gross lobha but also the degrees of lobha
which are more subtle. The following sutta gives an example of lobha
which is more subtle. We read in the Kindred Sayings (I, Sagāthā-vagga
IX, Forest Suttas paragraph 14):

> A certain monk was once staying among the Kosalese in a certain
> forest-tract. Now while there was that monk, after he had returned
> from his alms-round and had broken his fast, plunged into the
> lotus-pool and sniffed up the perfume of a red lotus. Then the deva
> who haunted that forest tract, moved with compassion for that monk,
> desiring his welfare, and wishing to agitate him, drew near and
> addressed him in the verse:


   
 
	 "That blossom, water-born, thing not given, 
	 You stand sniffing up the scent of it. 
	 This is one class of things that may be stolen. 
	 And you a smell-thief must I call, dear sir." 
	 
	 (The monk:) 
	 
	 "Nay, nought I bear away, I nothing break. 
	 Standing apart I smell the water's child. 
	 Now for what reason am I smell-thief called? 
	 One who does dig up water-lilies, one 
	 Who feeds on lotuses, in motley tasks 
	 Engaged: why have you no such name for him?" 
	 
	 (The Deva:) 
	 
	 "A man of ruthless, wicked character, 
	 Foul-flecked as is a handmaid's dirty cloth: 
	 With such the words I say have no concern. 
	 But this it is meet that I should say (to you): 
	 To him whose character is void of vice, 
	 Who ever makes quest for what is pure: 
	 What to the wicked but a hair-tip seems, 
	 To him does great as a rain-cloud appear..." 
 


We should also know the more subtle lobha which arises when we enjoy a
fragrant smell or beautiful music. It seems that there are no akusala
cittas when we do not harm others, but also the more subtle lobha is
akusala; it is different from generosity which is kusala. We cannot
force ourselves not to have lobha, but we can come to know the
characteristic of lobha when it appears.

Not only the suttas, but also the Vinaya (Book of Discipline for the
monks) gives examples of lobha which is more subtle. Each part of the
teachings, the Vinaya, the Suttanta and the Abhidhamma can help us to
know ourselves better. When we read the Vinaya we see that even monks
who lead a life with contentment with little, still have accumulated
conditions for lobha. Every time there was a case where monks deviated
from their purity of life, a rule was laid down in order to help them to
be more watchful. Thus we can understand the usefulness of the rules,
which go into even the smallest details of the monk’s behaviour. The
rules help the monk to be watchful even when performing the most common
actions of daily life such as eating, drinking, robing himself and
walking. There are rules which forbid seemingly innocent actions like
playing in the water or with the water (Expiation, Pācittiya 53), or
teasing other monks. Such actions are not done with kusala cittas, but
with akusala cittas.

We read in the Vinaya (III, Suttavibhaṇga, Expiation, Pācittiya 85) that
the monks should not enter a village at the wrong time. The reason is
that they would indulge more easily in worldly talk. We read:

> Now at that time the group of six monks, having entered a village at
> the wrong time, having sat down in a hall, talked a variety of worldly
> talk, that is to say: talk of kings, of thieves, of great ministers,
> of armies, of fears, of battles, of food, of drink, of clothes, of
> beds, of garlands, of scents, of relations, of vehicles, of villages,
> of little towns, of towns, of the country, of women, of strong drink,
> of streets, of wells, of those departed before, of diversity, of
> speculation about the world, about the sea, on becoming and not
> becoming thus and thus...

This passage is useful for laypeople as well. We cannot help talking
about worldly matters, but we should know that our talking, even if it
seems innocent, is often motivated by lobha-mūla-cittas or by
dosa-mūla-cittas (cittas rooted in aversion). In order to know ourselves
we should find out by what kind of citta our talking is motivated.

Every time a lobha-mūla-citta arises lobha is accumulated. When the
conditions are there, lobha can motivate ill deeds through body, speech
or mind. When we see to what kinds of deeds lobha can lead we will be
more inclined to develop the wisdom which eventually will lead to its
eradication.

Ill deeds are called in Pāli: akusala kamma. Kamma is the cetasika
(mental factor arising with the citta) which is intention or volition,
in Pāli: cetanā. However, the word “kamma” is also used in a more
general sense for the deeds which are intended by cetanā. The term
kamma-patha (literally “course of action”) is used as well in this
sense. There are akusala kamma-pathas and kusala kamma-pathas, ill deeds
and good deeds, accomplished through body, speech and mind. As regards
akusala kamma-patha, there are ten akusala kamma-pathas and these are
conditioned by lobha, dosa and moha. Moha, ignorance, accompanies every
akusala citta, it is the root of all evil. Thus, whenever there is
akusala kamma-patha, there must be moha. Some akusala kamma-pathas can
sometimes be performed with lobha-mūla-citta and sometimes with
dosa-mūla-citta. Therefore, when we see someone else committing an ill
deed we cannot always be sure which kind of citta motivates that deed.

The ten akusala kamma-pathas are the following:

1. Killing
2. Stealing
3. Sexual misbehaviour
4. Lying
5. Slandering
6. Rude speech
7. Frivolous talk
8. Covetousness
9. Ill-will
10. Wrong view (diṭṭhi)

Killing, stealing and sexual misbehaviour are three akusala kamma-pathas
accomplished through the body. Lying, slandering, rude speech and
frivolous talk are four akusala kamma-pathas accomplished through
speech. Covetousness, ill-will and wrong view are three akusala
kamma-pathas accomplished through the mind. As regards akusala
kamma-patha through the body, killing is done with dosa-mūla-citta.
Stealing can sometimes be performed with lobha-mūla-citta and sometimes
with dosa-mūla-citta. It is done with lobha-mūla-citta if one wishes to
take what belongs to someone else in order to enjoy it oneself. It is
done with dosa-mūla-citta if one wishes someone else to suffer damage.
Sexual misbehaviour is performed with lobha-mūla-citta.

As far as the akusala kamma-pathas through speech are concerned, lying,
slandering and frivolous talk are performed with lobha-mūla-citta if one
wishes to obtain something for oneself, or if one wishes to endear
oneself to other people. As regards lying, we may think that there is no
harm in a so-called “white lie” or a lie said for fun. However, all
kinds of lies are motivated by akusala cittas. We read in the “Discourse
on an Exhortation to Rāhula at Ambalaṭṭhikā” (Middle Length Sayings II,
no. 61, Bhikkhu-vagga) that the Buddha spoke to his son Rāhula about
lying. The Buddha said:

> Even so, Rāhula, of anyone for whom there is no shame at intentional
> lying, of him I say that there is no evil he cannot do. Wherefore, for
> you, Rāhula, “I will not speak a lie, even for fun” - this is how you
> must train yourself, Rāhula.

Lying can also be done with dosa-mūla-citta and this is the case when
one wants to harm someone else.

As regards slandering, we all are inclined to talk about others. When
there is no intention to harm the reputation of others, there is no
akusala kamma-patha. However, when talking about others becomes a habit,
there can easily be an occasion for akusala kamma-patha. This kind of
akusala kamma-patha is performed with lobha-mūla-citta if one slanders
in order to obtain something for oneself or in order to please others.
It is performed with dosa-mūla-citta if one wants to harm someone else.
We will be less inclined to talk about others or to judge them when we
see ourselves and others as phenomena which arise because of conditions
and which do not stay. At the moment we talk about other people’s
actions, these phenomena have fallen away already; what they said or did
exists no more.

Rude speech is performed with dosa-mūla-citta. Frivolous talk is talk
about idle, senseless things. This kind of talk can be performed with
lobha-mūla-citta or with dosa-mūla-citta. Frivolous talk is not always
akusala kamma-patha. It can be done with akusala citta which does not
have the intensity of akusala kamma-patha.

As regards akusala kamma-patha through the mind, ill-will, the intention
to hurt or harm someone else, is motivated by dosa-mūla-citta;
covetousness and wrong view are motivated by lobha-mūla-citta
[(18)](#FOOT18). There is akusala kamma-patha which is covetousness when
one intends to obtain by dishonest means what belongs to someone else.
As regards diṭṭhi (wrong view), there are many kinds of diṭṭhi; however,
three kinds of diṭṭhi are akusala kamma-patha through the mind. One of
them is ahetuka-diṭṭhi, the belief that there is no cause for the
existence of beings and no cause for their purity or corruption. Another
wrong view which is akusala kamma-patha through the mind is
akiriyā-diṭṭhi, the belief that there are no good and bad deeds which
produce their results. The third wrong view which is akusala kamma-patha
through the mind is natthika-diṭṭhi or annihilation view.
Natthika-diṭṭhi is the belief that there is no result of kamma and that
there is no further life after death.

All degrees of lobha, be it coarse or more subtle, bring sorrow. We are
like slaves so long as we are absorbed in and infatuated with the
objects which present themselves through eyes, ears, nose, tongue,
bodysense and mind. We are not free if our happiness depends on the
situation we are in, and the way others behave towards us. One moment
people may be kind to us, but the next moment they may behave in an
unpleasant way towards us. If we attach too much importance to the
affection of others, we shall be easily disturbed in mind, and thus
become slaves of our moods and emotions.

We can become more independent and free if we realize that both we
ourselves and other people are only nāma and rūpa, phenomena arising
because of conditions and falling away again. When others speak in an
unpleasant way to us there are conditions which cause them to speak in
that way, and there are conditions which cause us to hear such speech.
Other people’s behaviour and our reactions to it are conditioned
phenomena which do not stay. At the moment we are thinking about these
phenomena, they have fallen away already. The development of insight is
the way to become less dependent on the vicissitudes of life. When there
is more understanding of the present moment, we will attach less
importance to the way people behave towards us.

Since lobha is rooted so deeply, it can only be eradicated in different
stages. Diṭṭhi has to be eradicated first. The sotāpanna, the person who
has realized the first stage of enlightenment, has eradicated diṭṭhi. He
has developed the wisdom which realizes that all phenomena are nāma and
rūpa, not self. Since he has eradicated diṭṭhi, the lobha-mūla-cittas
with diṭṭhi do not arise anymore. As we have seen, four types of
lobha-mūla-citta arise with diṭṭhi (they are diṭṭhigata-sampayutta), and
four types arise without diṭṭhi (they are diṭṭhigatha-vippayutta). As
for the sotāpanna, the four types of lobha-mūla-citta without diṭṭhi
still arise; he has not yet eradicated all kinds of attachment. The
sotāpanna still has conceit. Conceit can arise with the four types of
lobha-mūla-citta which are without diṭṭhi (diṭṭhigata-vippayutta). There
may be conceit when one compares oneself with others, when one, for
example, thinks that one has more wisdom than others. When we consider
ourselves better, equal or less in comparison with others we may find
ourselves important and then there is conceit. When we think ourselves
less than someone else it is not necessarily kusala; there may still be
a kind of upholding of ourselves and then there is conceit. Conceit is
rooted so deeply that it is eradicated only when one has become an
arahat.

The person who has attained the second stage of enlightenment, the
sakadāgāmī (once-returner), has less lobha than the sotāpanna. The
person who has attained the third stage of enlightenment, the anāgāmī
(never-returner), has no more clinging to the objects which present
themselves through the five senses, but he still has conceit and he
clings to rebirth. The arahat, the perfected one who has attained the
fourth and last stage of enlightenment, has eradicated all forms of
lobha completely.

The arahat is completely free since he has eradicated all defilements.
We read in the Kindred Sayings (IV, Saḷāyatanavagga, Kindred Sayings on
Sense, Third Fifty, chapter IV, paragraph 136, Not including), that the
Buddha said to the monks, while he was staying among the Sakkas at
Devadaha:

> Devas and mankind, monks, delight in objects, they are excited by
> objects. It is owing to the instability, the coming to an end, the
> ceasing of objects, monks, that devas and mankind live woefully. They
> delight in sounds, scents, savours, in touch, they delight in
> mindstates, and are excited by them. It is owing to the instability,
> the coming to an end, the ceasing of mindstates, monks, that devas and
> mankind live woefully.
>
> But the Tathāgata, monks, who is arahat, a Fully-enlightened One,
> seeing, as they really are, both the arising and the destruction, the
> satisfaction, the misery and the way of escape from objects, - he
> delights not in objects, takes not pleasure in them, is not excited by
> them. It is owing to the instability, the coming to an end, the
> ceasing of objects that the Tathāgata dwells at ease...

The Buddha and all those who are arahats have eradicated clinging to all
objects which are experienced. They have penetrated the true nature of
conditioned realities which arise and fall away, which are impermanent.
The arahat will attain the end of rebirth, the cessation of the arising
of conditioned realities and therefore, he is “dwelling at ease”.
