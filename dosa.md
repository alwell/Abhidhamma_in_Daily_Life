The Characteristic of Dosa 
==========================

When we are angry with other people we harm ourselves by our anger. The
Buddha pointed out the adverse effects of anger (dosa). We read in the
Gradual Sayings (Book of the Sevens, chapter VI, paragraph 10, Anger)
about the ills a rival wishes his rival to have and which are actually
the ills coming upon an angry woman or man. The sutta states:

> ...Monks, there is the case of a rival, who wishes thus of a rival:
> “Would that he were ugly!” And why? A rival, monks, does not like a
> handsome rival. Monks, this sort of person, being angry, is
> overwhelmed by anger; he is subverted by anger: and however well he be
> bathed, anointed, trimmed as to the hair and beard, clad in spotless
> linen; yet for all that he is ugly, being overwhelmed by anger. Monks,
> this is the first condition, fostered by rivals, causing rivals, which
> comes upon an angry woman or man.
>
> Again, there is the case of a rival, who wishes thus of a rival:
> “Would that he might sleep badly!” And why? A rival, monks, does not
> like a rival to sleep well. Monks, this sort of person, being angry,
> is overwhelmed by anger; he is subverted by anger: and in spite of his
> lying on a couch, spread with a fleecy cover, spread with a white
> blanket, spread with a woollen coverlet, flower embroidered, covered
> with rugs of antelope skins, with awnings above; or on a sofa, with
> crimson cushions at either end; yet for all that he lies in
> discomfort, being overwhelmed by anger. Monks, this is the second
> condition...

We then read about other misfortunes a rival wishes for his rival, which
come upon an angry woman or man. We read that a rival wishes his rival
to be without prosperity, wealth and fame. Further we read that a rival
wishes a rival to be without friends and this happens to someone who is
an angry person. The text states:

> Monks, this sort of person, being angry ...whatever friends, intimates,
> relations and kinsmen he may have, they will avoid him and keep far
> away from him, because he is overwhelmed by anger...

A rival wishes his rival to have an unhappy rebirth and this can happen
to an angry person. We read:

> ...Monks, this sort of person, being angry ...he misconducts himself in
> deed, in word and thought; so living, so speaking and so thinking, on
> breaking up of the body after death he is reborn in the untoward way,
> the ill way, the abyss, hell...

We would like to live in a world of harmony and unity among nations and
we are disturbed when people commit acts of violence. We should consider
what the real cause is of war and discord between people: it is the
defilements which people have accumulated. When we have aversion we
think that other people or unpleasant situations are the cause of our
aversion. However, our accumulation of dosa is the real cause for
aversion to arise time and again. If we want to have less dosa we should
know the characteristic of dosa and we should be aware of it when it
arises.

Dosa has many degrees; it can be a slight aversion or it can be more
coarse, such as anger. We can recognize dosa when it is coarse, but do
we realize that we have dosa when it is more subtle? Through the study
of the Abhidhamma we learn more about the characteristic of dosa. Dosa
is an akusala cetasika (mental factor) arising with akusala citta; it is
a cetasika that is an unwholesome root, akusala hetu. A citta rooted in
dosa is called in Pāli: dosa-mūla-citta. The characteristic of dosa is
different from the characteristic of lobha. When there is lobha, the
citta likes the object which it experiences at that moment, whereas when
there is dosa, the citta has aversion towards the object it experiences.
We can recognize dosa when we are angry with someone and when we speak
disagreeable words to him. But when we are afraid of something there is
dosa as well, because one has aversion towards the object one is afraid
of. There are so many things in life we are afraid of; we are afraid of
the future, of diseases, of accidents, of death. We look for many means
in order to be cured of anguish, but the only way is the development of
the wisdom which eradicates the latent tendency of dosa.

Dosa is conditioned by lobha: we do not want to lose what is dear to us
and when this actually happens we are sad. Sadness is dosa, it is
akusala. If we do not know things as they are, we believe that people
and things last. However, people and things are only phenomena which
arise and then fall away immediately. The next moment they have changed
already. If we can see things as they are we will be less overwhelmed by
sadness. It makes no sense to be sad about what has happened already.

In the Psalms of the Sisters (Therīgāthā, 33) we read that the King’s
wife Ubbirī mourned the loss of her daughter Jīvā. Every day she went to
the cemetery. She met the Buddha who told her that in that cemetery
about eighty-four thousand of her daughters (in past lives) had been
burnt. The Buddha said to her:


   
 
	 O, Ubbirī, who wails in the wood 
	 Crying, "O Jīvā! O my daughter dear!" 
	 Come to yourself! See, in this burying-ground 
	 Are burnt full many a thousand daughters dear, 
	 And all of them were named like her. 
	 Now which of all those Jīvās do you mourn? 
 


After Ubbirī pondered over the Dhamma thus taught by the Buddha she
developed insight and saw things as they really are; she even attained
arahatship.

There are other akusala cetasikas which can arise with cittas rooted in
dosa. Regret or worry, in Pāli: *kukkucca*, is an akusala cetasika which
arises with dosa-mūla-citta at the moment we regret something bad we did
or something good we omitted to do. When there is regret we are thinking
of the past instead of knowing the present moment. When we have done
something wrong it is of no use to have aversion.

Envy (*issā*) is another cetasika which can arise with dosa-mūla-citta.
There is envy when we do not like someone else to enjoy pleasant things.
At that moment the citta does not like the object it experiences. We
should find out how often envy arises, even when it is more subtle. This
is a way to know whether we really care for someone else or whether we
only think of ourselves when we associate with others.

Stinginess (*macchariya*) is another akusala cetasika which may arise
with dosa-mūla-citta. When we are stingy there is dosa as well. At that
moment we do not like someone else to share in our good fortune.

Dosa always arises with an unpleasant feeling (domanassa vedanā). Most
people do not like to have dosa because they do not like to have an
unpleasant feeling. As we develop more understanding of realities we
want to eradicate dosa not so much because we dislike unpleasant
feeling, but rather because we realize the adverse effects of akusala.

Dosa can arise on account of the objects experienced through the five
sense-doors and the mind-door. It can arise when we see ugly sights,
hear harsh sounds, smell unpleasant odours, taste unappetizing food,
experience unpleasant tangible objects through the bodysense and think
of disagreeable things. Whenever there is a feeling of uneasiness, no
matter how slight, it is evident that there is dosa. Dosa may often
arise when there is the experience of unpleasant objects through the
senses, for example, when the temperature is too hot or too cold.
Whenever there is a slightly unpleasant bodily sensation dosa may arise,
be it only of a lesser degree.

Dosa arises when there are conditions for it. It arises so long as there
is still attachment to the objects which can be experienced through the
five senses. Everybody would like to experience only pleasant things and
when one does not have them any more, dosa may arise.

Another condition for dosa is ignorance of the Dhamma. If we are
ignorant of kamma and vipāka, cause and result, dosa may arise very
easily on account of an unpleasant experience through one of the senses
and thus dosa is accumulated time and again. An unpleasant experience
through one of the senses is akusala vipāka caused by an unwholesome
deed we performed. When, for example, someone speaks unpleasant words to
us, we may be angry with that person. Those who have studied the Dhamma
know that hearing an unpleasant sound is akusala vipāka which is not
caused by someone else but by an unwholesome deed performed by oneself.
A moment of vipāka falls away immediately, it does not stay. Are we not
inclined to keep on thinking about an unpleasant experience? If there is
more awareness of the present moment one will be less inclined to think
with aversion about one’s akusala vipāka.

When we study the Abhidhamma we learn that there are two types of
dosa-mūla-citta: one of these is unprompted (*asaṅkhārika*) and one is
prompted (*sasaṅkhārika*). Dosa is prompted (sasaṅkhārika) when, for
example, one becomes angry after having been reminded of the
disagreeable actions of someone else. Dosa-mūla-cittas are always
accompanied by domanassa (unpleasant feeling). There are two types of
dosa-mūla-citta which are the following:

1. Accompanied by unpleasant feeling, arising with anger, unprompted
 (Domanassa-sahagataṃ, paṭigha-sampayuttaṃ [(19)](#FOOT19),
 asaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).
2. Accompanied by unpleasant feeling, arising with anger, prompted
 (Domanassa-sahagataṃ, paṭigha-sampayuttaṃ, sasaṅkhārikam ekaṃ).

As we have seen, there are many degrees of dosa; it may be coarse or
more subtle. When dosa is coarse, it causes akusala kamma-patha
(unwholesome deeds) through body, speech or mind. Two kinds of akusala
kamma-patha through the body can be performed with dosa-mūla-citta:
killing and stealing. If we want less violence in the world we should
try not to kill. When we kill we accumulate a great deal of dosa. The
monk’s life should be a life of non-violence; he should not hurt any
living being in the world. However, not everyone is able to live like
the monks. Defilements are anattā (not self); they arise because of
conditions. The purpose of the Buddha’s teaching is not to lay down
rules which forbid people to commit ill deeds, but to help people to
develop the wisdom which eradicates defilements. There are precepts for
laypeople, but these are rules of training rather than commandments.

As regards stealing, this can either be performed with lobha-mūla-citta
or with dosa-mūla-citta. It is done with dosa-mūla-citta when there is
the intention to harm someone else. Doing damage to someone else’s
possessions is included in this kamma-patha.

Four kinds of akusala kamma-patha through speech can be performed with
dosa-mūla-citta: lying, slandering, rude speech and frivolous talk.
Lying, slandering and frivolous talk can either be performed with
lobha-mūla-citta or with dosa-mūla-citta. Slandering, for example, is
performed with dosa-mūla-citta when there is the intention to cause
damage to someone else, such as doing harm to his good name and causing
him to be looked down upon by others. Most people think that the use of
weapons is to be avoided, but they forget that the tongue can be a
weapon as well, a weapon which can badly wound. Evil speech does a great
deal of harm in the world; it causes discord between people. When we
speak evil we harm ourselves, because at such moments akusala kamma is
accumulated and it is capable of producing akusala vipāka.

We read in the Sutta Nipāta (Chapter III, the Great Chapter, 10,
Kokāliya, “Khuddaka Nikāya”) that while the Buddha was staying at
Sāvatthī, the bhikkhu Kokāliya visited him. Kokāliya spoke evil of
Sāriputta and Moggallāna, saying that they had evil desires. Three times
the Buddha told him not to speak in that way. After Kokāliya had
departed boils developed all over his body which became bigger and
bigger and discharged pus and blood. He died and was reborn in the
Paduma hell. Later on the Buddha told the monks about Kokāliya’s evil
speech and his rebirth in hell. We read (vs. 657, 658) that the Buddha
said:

> “Surely in the mouth of a man, when born, an axe is born, with which
> the fool cuts himself, saying a badly-spoken (utterance).
>
> He who praises him who is to be blamed, or blames him who is to be
> praised, accumulates evil by his mouth. Because of that evil he does
> not find happiness...

As regards akusala kamma-patha through the mind performed with
dosa-mūla-citta, this is the intention to hurt or harm someone else.

People often speak about violence and the ways to cure it. Who of us can
say that he is free from dosa and that he will never kill? We do not
know how much dosa we have accumulated in the course of many lives. When
the conditions are present we might commit an act of violence we did not
realize we were capable of. When we understand how ugly dosa is and to
what deeds it can lead we want to eradicate it.

In performing kind deeds we cannot eradicate the latent tendency of
dosa, but at least at those moments we do not accumulate more dosa. The
Buddha exhorted people to cultivate loving kindness (mettā). We read in
the Karaniya Mettā-sutta (Sutta Nipāta, vs. 143-152) [(20)](#FOOT20)
that the Buddha spoke the following words.


   
 
	 What should be done by one skillful in good 
	 So as to gain the State of Peace is this: 
	 
	 Let him be able, and upright, and straight. 
	 Easy to speak to, gentle, and not proud, 
	 Contented too, supported easily, 
	 With few tasks, and living very lightly, 
	 His faculties serene, prudent and modest, 
	 Unswayed by the emotions of the clans; 
	 And let him never do the slightest thing 
	 That other wise men might hold blamable. 
	 
	 (And let him think) 

	"In safety and in bliss 
	 May creatures all be of a blissful heart. 
	 Whatever breathing beings there may be, 
	 No matter whether they are frail or firm, 
	 With none excepted, be they long or big 
	 Or middle-sized, or be they short or small 
	 Or thick, as well as those seen or unseen, 
	 Or whether they are dwelling far or near, 
	 Existing or yet seeking to exist, 
	 May creatures all be of a blissful heart. 
	 Let no one work another one's undoing 
	 Or even slight him at all anywhere; 
	 And never let them wish each other ill 
	 Through provocation or resentful thought." 
	 
	 And just as might a mother with her life 
	 Protect the son that was her only child, 
	 So let him then for every living thing 
	 Maintain unbounded consciousness in being, 
	 And let him too with love for all the world 
	 Maintain unbounded consciousness in being 
	 Above, below, and all around in between, 
	 Untroubled, with no enemy or foe. 
	 And while he stands, or walks or while he sits 
	 Or while he lies down, free from drowsiness, 
	 Let him resolve upon mindfulness: 
	 This is Divine Abiding here, they say. 
	 
	 But when he has no trafficking with views (21), 
	 Is virtuous, and has perfected seeing, 
	 And purges greed for sensual desires, 
	 He surely comes no more to any womb. 
 


The Buddha taught us not to be angry with those who are unpleasant to
us. We read in the Vinaya (Mahāvagga X, 349) that the Buddha said to the
monks:


   
 
	 They who (in thought) belabour this: 
	 That man has me abused, has hurt, has worsted me, 
	 has me despoiled: in these wrath is not allayed. 
	 They who do not belabour this: That 
	 man has me abused, has hurt, has worsted me, 
	 has me despoiled: in them wrath is allayed. 
	 
	 Nay, not by wrath are wrathful moods 
	 allayed here (and) at any time, 
	 but by not-wrath are they allayed: 
	 this is an (ageless) endless rule. 
 


At times it seems impossible for us to have mettā instead of dosa. For
example, when people treat us badly we may feel very unhappy and we keep
on pondering over our misery. So long as dosa has not been eradicated
there are still conditions for its arising. By being mindful of all
realities which appear the wisdom is developed which can eventually
eradicate dosa.

Dosa can only be eradicated stage by stage. The sotāpanna (the
streamwinner, who has attained the first stage of enlightenment) has not
yet eradicated dosa and also at the subsequent stage of enlightenment,
the stage of the sakadāgāmī (once-returner), dosa is not yet eradicated
completely. The anāgāmī (the non-returner, who has attained the third
stage of enlightenment) has eradicated dosa completely; he has no more
latent tendency of dosa.

We have not eradicated dosa, but when dosa appears, we can be mindful of
its characteristic in order to know it as a type of nāma, arising
because of conditions. When there is no mindfulness of dosa when it
appears, dosa seems to last and we take it for self. Through mindfulness
of nāmas and rūpas which present themselves one at a time, we will learn
that there are different characteristics of nāma and rūpa, none of which
lasts and we will also know the characteristic of dosa as only a type of
nāma, not self.

When a clearer understanding of realities is developed we will be less
inclined to ponder for a long time over an unpleasant experience, since
it is only a type of nāma which does not last. We will attend more to
the present moment instead of thinking about the past or the future. We
will also be less inclined to tell other people about unpleasant things
which have happened to us, since that may be a condition for both
ourselves and others to accumulate more dosa. When someone is angry with
us we will have more understanding of his situation; he may be tired or
not feeling well. Those who treat us badly deserve compassion because
they actually make themselves unhappy.

Right understanding of realities will help us most of all to have more
loving kindness and compassion towards others instead of dosa.
