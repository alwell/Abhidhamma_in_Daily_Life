Ahetuka Cittas which are Unknown in Daily Life 
==============================================

There are eighteen types of ahetuka citta, cittas arising without hetu
(root). Fifteen types of ahetuka cittas are vipāka. As we have seen, ten
of these fifteen cittas are dvi-pañca-viññāṇas (five pairs). They are
the pairs of:

- seeing-consciousness
- hearing-consciousness
- smelling-consciousness
- tasting-consciousness
- body-consciousness

Each of these is a pair of which one is akusala vipāka and one kusala
vipāka.

Seeing-consciousness is the result of kamma. When it is the result of an
ill deed, seeing-consciousness is akusala vipākacitta which experiences
an unpleasant object; when it is the result of a good deed, it is kusala
vipākacitta which experiences a pleasant object. The function of
seeing-consciousness is experiencing visible object.

Kamma which produces the vipākacitta which is seeing-consciousness does
not only produce that type of vipākacitta, it also produces two other
types of vipākacitta which succeed seeing-consciousness.
Seeing-consciousness is succeeded by another vipākacitta which receives
the object. This citta, which still has the same object as
seeing-consciousness, is called the receiving-consciousness,
sampaṭicchana-citta. Visible object which is experienced by
seeing-consciousness does not fall away when seeing-consciousness falls
away, because it is rūpa; rūpa does not fall away as rapidly as nāma.
When an object is experienced through one of the six doors, there is not
merely one citta experiencing that object, but there is a series or
process of cittas succeeding one another, which share the same object.

If the seeing-consciousness is akusala vipāka, the sampaṭicchana-citta
(receiving-consciousness) is also akusala vipāka; if the
seeing-consciousness is kusala vipāka, the sampaṭicchana-citta is also
kusala vipāka. Thus, there are two types of sampaṭicchana-citta: one is
akusala vipāka and one is kusala vipāka. Sampaṭicchana-citta is ahetuka
vipāka; there are no akusala hetus (unwholesome roots) or sobhana hetus
(beautiful roots) arising with this type of citta. Sampaṭicchana-citta
succeeds seeing-consciousness; seeing-consciousness is a condition for
the arising of sampaṭicchana-citta. Likewise, when there is
hearing-consciousness which hears sound, sampaṭicchana-citta succeeds
hearing-consciousness. It is the same with regard to the other
sense-doors.

Sampaṭicchana-citta always arises with upekkhā (indifferent feeling), no
matter whether the sampaṭicchana-citta is akusala vipāka or kusala
vipāka.

After the sampaṭicchana-citta has arisen and fallen away, the process of
cittas experiencing an object is not yet over. The sampaṭicchana-citta
is succeeded by another ahetuka vipākacitta which is still the result of
kamma. This type of citta is called investigating-consciousness,
santīraṇa-citta. Santīraṇa-citta investigates or considers the object
which was experienced by one of the dvi-pañca-viññāṇas (“the five
pairs”), and which was “received” by the sampaṭicchana-citta.
Santīraṇa-citta succeeds sampaṭicchana-citta in a process of cittas
experiencing an object through one of the five sense-doors;
sampaṭicchana-citta is a condition for the arising of santīraṇa-citta.
When seeing has arisen, sampaṭicchana-citta succeeds the
seeing-consciousness, and santīraṇa-citta succeeds the
sampaṭicchana-citta in the process of cittas which experience visible
object. It is the same with the santīraṇa-citta which arises in the
process of cittas experiencing an object through one of the other
sense-doors; it succeeds the sampaṭicchana-citta. We cannot choose
whether santīraṇa-citta should arise or not; cittas arise because of
conditions, they are beyond control.

Santīraṇa-citta is also an ahetuka vipākacitta. When the object is
unpleasant, the santīraṇa-citta is akusala vipāka and it is accompanied
by upekkhā (indifferent feeling). As regards santīraṇa-citta which is
kusala vipāka, there are two kinds. When the object is pleasant but not
extraordinarily pleasant, santīraṇa-citta is accompanied by upekkhā.
When the object is extraordinarily pleasant, the santīraṇa-citta is
accompanied by somanassa, pleasant feeling. Thus, there are three kinds
of santīraṇa-citta in all. It depends on conditions which kind of
santīraṇa-citta arises.

Thus, there are fifteen types of ahetuka citta which are vipāka.
Summarising them, they are:

- 10 cittas which are dvi-pañca-viññāṇa (five pairs)
- 1 sampaṭicchana-citta (receiving-consciousness) which is akusala
 vipāka
- 1 sampaṭicchana-citta which is kusala vipāka
- 1 santīraṇa-citta (investigating-consciousness) which is akusala
 vipāka, accompanied by upekkhā (indifferent feeling)
- 1 santīraṇa-citta which is kusala vipāka, accompanied by upekkhā
- 1 santīraṇa-citta which is kusala vipāka, accompanied by somanassa
 (pleasant feeling)

Seven types of the ahetuka vipākacittas are akusala vipāka and eight
types are kusala vipāka, since there are two types of santīraṇa-citta
which are kusala vipāka.

There are altogether eighteen ahetuka cittas. Of these eighteen ahetuka
cittas fifteen are vipākacittas and three are *kiriyacittas*.
Kiriyacittas are different from akusala cittas and kusala cittas and
from vipākacittas. Akusala cittas and kusala cittas are cittas which are
cause; they can motivate ill deeds and good deeds which are capable of
producing their appropriate results. Vipākacittas are cittas which are
the result of akusala kamma and kusala kamma. Kiriyacittas are cittas
which are neither cause nor result.

One type of ahetuka kiriyacitta is the
five-door-adverting-consciousness, in Pāli: pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta
[(32)](#FOOT32). When an object impinges on one of the five senses,
there has to be a citta which adverts or turns towards the object
through that sense-door. When visible object impinges on the eyesense,
there has to be the adverting-consciousness which adverts to visible
object through the eye-door, the eye-door-adverting-consciousness
(cakkhu-dvārāvajjana-citta; “cakkhu” means “eye”), before there can be
seeing-consciousness (cakkhu-viññāṇa). When sound impinges on the
earsense, the ear-door-adverting-consciousness (
sota-dvārāvajjana-citta; “sota” means “ear”) has to advert to the sound
through the ear-door before there can be hearing-consciousness
(sota-viññāṇa). The pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta merely turns towards the
object which impinges on one of the five senses. It turns, for example,
towards the visible object or sound which impinges on the corresponding
sense-organ, but it does not see or hear. The pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta
is an ahetuka kiriyacitta, it arises without hetu (root); there is not
yet like or dislike when this citta arises. The pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta
is succeeded by one of the dvi-pañca-viññāṇas, which is vipākacitta.
Each citta which arises in the process of cittas experiencing an object
has its own function.

The cittas which experience an object through one of the sense-doors do
not know anything else but that object. When one, for example, is
reading, the citta which sees experiences only visible object and it
does not know the meaning of the letters. After the eye-door process has
been completed visible object is experienced through the mind-door and
then there can be other mind-door processes of cittas which know the
meaning of what has been written and which think about it. Thus, there
are processes of cittas which experience an object through one of the
senses and processes of cittas which experience an object through the
mind-door.

Another type of ahetuka kiriyacitta is the
mind-door-adverting-consciousness, in Pāli: mano-dvārāvajjana citta.
This type of citta arises both in the sense-door process and in the
mind-door process but it performs two different functions according as
it arises in each of those two kinds of processes, as we will see.

When an object contacts one of the sense-doors, the
pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta (five-sense-door-adverting consciousness) turns
towards the object, one of the dvi-pañca-viññāṇas experiences it,
sampaṭicchana-citta receives the object and santīraṇa-citta investigates
it. The process of cittas experiencing the object through that
sense-door is, however, not yet over. The santīraṇa-citta is succeeded
by an ahetuka kiriyacitta which experiences the object through that
sense-door and “determines” that object, the determining-consciousness,
in Pāli: votthapana-citta [(33)](#FOOT33). It is actually the same type
of citta as the mano-dvārāvajjana-citta
(mind-door-adverting-consciousness, the first citta of the mind-door
process), but when it arises in a sense-door process it can be called
votthapana-citta, since it performs the function of votthapana,
determining the object, in the sense-door process. The votthapana-citta,
after it has determined the object, is followed by akusala cittas or by
kusala cittas [(34)](#FOOT34). The votthapana-citta itself is neither
akusala citta nor kusala citta; it is kiriyacitta. This citta which
determines the object is anattā, non-self. There is no self who can
determine whether there will be akusala cittas or kusala cittas. The
akusala cittas or kusala cittas which succeed the votthapana-citta are
non-self either; it depends on one’s accumulations of akusala and kusala
whether the votthapana-citta will be succeeded by akusala cittas or by
kusala cittas.

The cittas arising in a sense-door process which experience a sense
object such as colour or sound, arise and fall away, succeeding one
another. When the sense-door process of cittas is finished, the sense
object experienced by those cittas has also fallen away. Cittas arise
and fall away extremely rapidly and very shortly after the sense-door
process is finished, a mind-door process of cittas starts, which
experience the sense object which has just fallen away. Although it has
fallen away, it can be object of cittas arising in a mind-door process.
The mano-dvārāvajjana-citta is the first citta of the mind-door process,
it adverts through the mind-door to the object which has just fallen
away. In the sense-door process the pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta adverts to
the object which has not fallen away yet. For example, it adverts to
visible object or sound which is still impinging on the appropriate
sense-door. The mano-dvārāvajjana-citta which arises in the mind-door
process, however, can experience an object which has fallen away
already. It adverts, for example, to visible object which has been
experienced through the eye-door or to sound which has been experienced
through the ear-door. After the mano-dvārāvajjana-citta has adverted to
the object it is succeeded by either kusala cittas or akusala cittas (in
the case of non-arahats), which experience that same object. The
mano-dvārāvajjana-citta is neither akusala citta nor kusala citta; it is
kiriyacitta. It depends on one’s accumulations by which types of cittas
the mano-dvārāvajjana-citta is succeeded: by akusala cittas or by kusala
cittas. All cittas arise because of their own conditions; they are
anattā, not a person, not self.

The ahetuka kiriyacitta which is classified as mano-dvārāvajjana-citta
can perform two functions: in the mind-door process it performs the
function of āvajjana or adverting, it adverts to the object through the
mind-door; in the sense-door process this citta performs the function of
votthapana or determining the object. The citta which determines the
object in the sense-door process can be called, after its function, the
votthapana-citta [(35)](#FOOT35).

When sound impinges on the earsense it can be experienced by cittas
arising in the ear-door process and after that it is experienced by
cittas arising in a mind-door process. Processes of cittas which
experience an object through one of the five senses and through the
mind-door succeed one another time and again.

How can there be akusala cittas or kusala cittas in the process of
cittas which experience an object through one of the sense-doors, when
one does not even know yet what is experienced? There can be akusala
cittas or kusala cittas before one knows what it is. One can compare
this situation with the case of a child who likes a brightly coloured
object such as a balloon before it knows that the object is a balloon.
We can have like or dislike of an object before we know what it is.

Another ahetuka kiriyacitta is the hasituppāda-citta, the
smile-producing-consciousness of the arahat. Only arahats have this type
of citta. When they smile the hasituppāda-citta may arise at that
moment. Smiling can be motivated by different types of cittas. When
people who are not arahats smile, it may be motivated by lobha or by
kusala citta. Arahats do not have any defilements; they do not have
akusala cittas. Neither do they have kusala cittas; they do not
accumulate any more kamma. Instead of kusala cittas they have
kiriyacittas accompanied by sobhana (beautiful) roots, sobhana
kiriyacittas. Arahats do not laugh aloud, because they have no
accumulations for laughing; they only smile. When they smile the smiling
may be motivated by sobhana kiriyacitta or by the ahetuka kiriyacitta
which is called hasituppāda-citta.

Thus, of the eighteen ahetuka cittas, fifteen are ahetuka vipākacittas
and three are ahetuka kiriyacittas. The three ahetuka kiriyacittas are:

- 1 Pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta ( five-door-adverting-consciousness).
- 2 Mano-dvārāvajjana-citta ( mind-door-adverting-consciousness),
 which performs the function of adverting to the object through the
 mind-door when it arises in the mind-door process and which performs
 the function of votthapana (determining the object) when it arises
 in the sense-door process.
- 3 Hasituppāda-citta ( smile-producing-consciousness).

Those who are not arahats can have only seventeen of the eighteen types
of ahetuka citta. These seventeen types of ahetuka citta arise in our
daily life. When an object impinges on one of the five senses, the
pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta (the five-door-adverting-consciousness) turns
towards the object through that sense-door. This citta is followed by
pañca-viññāṇa (one of the ten cittas which are the “five pairs”) which
experiences the object, by sampaṭicchana-citta which receives it, by
santīraṇa-citta which investigates it and by votthapana-citta which
determines the object and then by akusala cittas or kusala cittas. When
the cittas of the sense-door process have fallen away the object is
experienced through the mind-door. The mano-dvārāvajjana-citta adverts
to the object through the mind-door and is then followed by akusala
cittas or kusala cittas. There is “unwise attention” (ayoniso
manasikāra) to the object which is experienced if akusala cittas arise,
and there is “wise attention” (yoniso manasikāra) to the object if
kusala cittas arise. For example, when we see insects there may be
dislike and then there are dosa-mūla-cittas, cittas rooted in aversion.
Thus there is unwise attention. The dosa may be so strong that one wants
to kill the insects; then there is akusala kamma. If one realizes that
killing is akusala and one abstains from killing, there are kusala
cittas and thus there is wise attention. If one studies the Dhamma and
develops vipassanā, insight, it is a condition for wise attention to
arise more often. When we are mindful of the nāma or rūpa which appears
through one of the sense-doors or through the mind-door, there is wise
attention at that moment.

When there are two people in the same situation, one person may have
unwise attention and the other may have wise attention, depending on
their accumulations. We read in the Kindred Sayings (IV,
Saḷāyatana-vagga, Kindred Sayings on Sense, Fourth Fifty, chapter V,
paragraph 202, Lustful) about the monk, who, after he has experienced an
object through one of the six doors, has unwise attention, and about the
monk who has wise attention. We read that Mahā-Moggallāna said to the
monks:

> Friends, I will teach you the way of lusting and also of not
> lusting...
>
> And how, friends, is one lustful?
>
> Herein, friends, a monk, seeing an object with the eye, feels
> attachment for objects that charm, feels aversion from objects that
> displease, abides without having established mindfulness of the body,
> and his thoughts are mean. He realizes not, in its true nature, that
> emancipation of heart, that emancipation of wisdom, wherein those
> evil, unprofitable states that have arisen cease without remainder.
>
> This monk, friends, is called “lustful after objects cognizable by the
> eye, nose, tongue ...objects cognizable by the mind.” When a monk so
> abides, friends, if Māra [(36)](#FOOT36) come upon him by way of the
> eye, Māra gets an opportunity. If Māra come upon him by way of the
> tongue ...by way of the mind, Māra gets access, gets opportunity...
>
> So dwelling, friends, objects overcome a monk, a monk overcomes not
> objects. Sounds overcome a monk, a monk overcomes not sounds. Scents,
> savours, tangibles and mind-states overcome a monk, a monk overcomes
> not sounds, scents, savours, tangibles and mind-states. This monk,
> friends, is called “conquered by objects, sounds, scents, savours,

> unhappy, whose fruit is pain, whose future is rebirth, decay and
> death. Thus, friends, one is lustful.
>
> And how, friends, is one free from lust?
>
> Herein, friends, a monk, seeing an object with the eye, is not
> attached to objects that charm, nor averse from objects that

>
> Tasting a savour with the tongue ...with mind cognizing a mind-state, he
> is not attached to mind-states that charm, nor is he averse from

>
> This monk, friends, is called “not lustful after objects cognizable by
> the eye ...not lustful after mind-states cognizable by the mind.” Thus
> dwelling, friends, if Māra come upon him by way of the eye, of the

>
> Moreover, friends, so dwelling a monk conquers objects, objects do not

> “conqueror of objects, sounds, scents, savours, tangibles and
> mind-states.” He is conqueror, not conquered. He conquers those evil,
> unprofitable states, passion-fraught, inciting to lust, leading to
> rebirth, states unhappy, whose fruit is pain, rebirth, decay and
> death. Thus, friends, is one free from lust.
