Samatha 
=======

We would like to have more wholesomeness in life, but often we are
unable to do wholesome deeds, to speak in a wholesome way or to think
wholesome thoughts. Our accumulated defilements hinder us in the
performing of kusala. We learn from the Buddhist teachings that there
are “hindrances” (nīvaraṇa), which are akusala cetasikas arising with
akusala cittas. The hindrances arise time and again in daily life. They
are:

- sensuous desire, in Pāli: kāmacchandha
- ill-will, in Pāli: vyāpāda
- torpor and languor, in Pāli: thīna and middha
- restlessness and worry, in Pāli: uddhacca and kukkucca
- doubt, in Pāli: vicikicchā

*Kāmacchandha* or sensuous desire is the cetasika which is lobha
(attachment). It is attachment to the objects we can experience through
the sense-doors and the mind-door. We all have kāmacchandha in different
forms and intensities. Because of economic progress and technical
inventions there is more prosperity in life. One can afford more things
which make life pleasant and comfortable. This, however, does not bring
contentedness; on the contrary, we are not satisfied with what we have
and we are forever looking for more enjoyment and happiness. There is
kāmacchandha with our deeds, words and thoughts. Even when we think that
we are doing good deeds and helping others, kāmacchandha can arise.
Kāmacchandha makes us restless and unhappy.

Vyāpāda or ill-will is the cetasika which is dosa. Vyāpāda can trouble
us many times a day; we feel irritated about other people or about
things which happen in life. Vyāpāda prevents us from kusala. When there
is vyāpāda we cannot have loving kindness and compassion for other
people.

*Thīna* and *middha* are translated as “torpor” and “languor”, or as
“sloth” and “torpor”. Thīna and middha cause us to have lack of energy
for kusala. The Visuddhimagga (XIV, 167) states concerning thīna and
middha:

> ...Herein, stiffness (thīna) has the characteristic of lack of driving
> power. Its function is to remove energy. It is manifested as
> subsiding. Torpor (middha) has the characteristic of unwieldiness. Its
> function is to smother. It is manifested as laziness, or it is
> manifested as nodding and sleep. The proximate cause of both is unwise
> attention to boredom, sloth, and so on.

Don’t we all have moments in a day when there is laziness and lack of
energy to perform kusala? When, for example, we are listening to the
preaching of Dhamma or reading the scriptures, there are opportunities
for kusala cittas. Instead, we may feel bored and we lack energy for
kusala. It may happen that we see someone else who needs our help, but
we are lazy and do not move. Time and again we are hindered by thīna and
middha. Thīna and middha make the mind unwieldy [(89)](#FOOT89).

Uddhacca is translated as “agitation” or “excitement” and kukkucca as
“worry” or “regret”. Uddhacca arises with each and every type of akusala
citta. It prevents the citta from wholesomeness. As regards kukkucca,
worry or regret, the Visuddhimagga (XIV, 174) states:

> ...It has subsequent regret as its characteristic. Its function is to
> sorrow about what has and what has not been done. It is manifested as
> remorse. Its proximate cause is what has and what has not been done.
> It should be regarded as slavery.

When we have done something wrong or we have not done the good deed we
should have done, we might be inclined to think about it again and
again. We may ask ourselves why we acted in the way we did, but we
cannot change what is past already. While we worry we have akusala
cittas; worry makes us enslaved. Uddhacca and kukkucca prevent us from
being tranquil.

As regards vicikicchā, doubt, there are many kinds of doubt. One may
have doubt about the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, or doubt about
the eightfold Path. Doubt is akusala and a hindrance to the performing
of kusala.

All of the hindrances are obstructions to the performing of kusala. Is
there a way to eliminate them? Samatha or the development of calm is a
way to temporarily eliminate the hindrances. The calm which is developed
in samatha has to be wholesome calm, it cannot arise with akusala citta.
There is a degree of calm with each kusala citta but it is hard to know
the characteristic of calm precisely, because there are bound to be
akusala cittas very shortly after the kusala cittas. In order to develop
the calm which is temporary freedom from the hindrances right
understanding, paññā, is indispensable. If one merely tries to
concentrate on a meditation subject without right understanding of
kusala and akusala and of the characteristic of calm, calm cannot grow.
The paññā of the level of samatha does not eradicate defilements, but it
knows the characteristic of calm and it knows how it can be developed by
means of a suitable meditation subject. Akusala citta is likely to arise
time and again, even when one tries to develop samatha. One may be
attached to silence and then there is akusala citta instead of the calm
of samatha. Or one may think, when there is no pleasant feeling nor
unpleasant feeling but indifferent feeling, that there is calm. However,
indifferent feeling can arise with kusala citta as well as with akusala
citta; lobha-mūla-citta can be accompanied by indifferent feeling and
moha-mūla-citta is invariably accompanied by indifferent feeling. Thus,
when there is indifferent feeling it may seem that one is calm, but
there is not necessarily the wholesome calm of samatha. The paññā of
samatha must be very keen so as to be able to recognize even the more
subtle defilements which arise.

We read in the scriptures about people who could attain jhāna if they
cultivated the right conditions for it. Before the Buddha’s
enlightenment, jhāna was the highest form of kusala people could attain.
Jhāna, which is sometimes translated as absorption [(90)](#FOOT90), is a
high degree of calm. At the moment of jhānacitta one is free from
sense-impressions and from the defilements which are bound up with them.
The attainment of jhāna is extremely difficult, not everybody who
applies himself to samatha can attain jhāna. However, even if one has no
intention to cultivate jhāna there can be conditions for moments of calm
in daily life; but one must have right understanding of the
characteristic of calm and of the way to develop it.

When one applies oneself to samatha one should develop five cetasikas
which can eliminate the hindrances; they are the jhāna-factors. The
first jhāna-factor is *vitakka*, which is translated into English as
“applied thinking”. Vitakka is a mental factor, a cetasika, which arises
with many kinds of citta; it can arise with kusala citta as well as with
akusala citta. The wholesome kind of vitakka which is developed in
samatha is one of the jhāna-factors. The Visuddhimagga (IV, 88) states
concerning vitakka:

> ...Herein, applied thinking (vitakkana) is applied thought (vitakka);
> hitting upon, is what is meant. It has the characteristic of directing
> the mind onto an object (mounting the mind on its object). Its
> function is to strike at and thresh - for the meditator is said, in
> virtue of it, to have the object struck at by applied thought,
> threshed by applied thought. It is manifested as the leading of the
> mind onto an object ...

Vitakka, when it is a jhāna-factor, is opposed to thīna and middha
(sloth and torpor). In “thinking” of the meditation subject vitakka
helps to inhibit thīna and middha temporarily [(91)](#FOOT91).

Another jhāna-factor is vicāra, which is translated as “sustained
thinking”. This cetasika arises with different kinds of citta, but when
it is developed in samatha, it is a jhāna-factor. The Visuddhimagga (IV,
88) states concerning vicāra:

> ...Sustained thinking (vicaraṇa) is sustained thought (vicāra);
> continued sustainment (anusañcaraṇa), is what is meant. It has the
> characteristic of continued pressure on (occupation with) the object.
> Its function is to keep conascent (mental) states (occupied) with
> that. It is manifested as keeping consciousness anchored (on that
> object).

In samatha, vicāra keeps the citta anchored on the meditation subject.
When we continue to think of wholesome subjects such as the Buddha’s
virtues or his teachings there is no vicikicchā or doubt. Vicāra helps
to inhibit doubt.

Another jhāna-factor is *pīti*, translated as “rapture”, “enthusiasm” or
“happiness”. Pīti can also arise with lobha-mūla-citta and then it is
akusala. The wholesome kind of pīti, arising with kusala citta, which is
developed in samatha is a jhāna-factor. The Visuddhimagga (IV, 94)
states concerning pīti:

> ...It refreshes (pīṇayati), thus it is happiness (pīti). It has the
> characteristic of endearing (sampiyāna). Its function is to refresh
> the body and the mind; or its function is to pervade (thrill with
> rapture). It is manifested as elation. But it is of five kinds as
> minor happiness, momentary happiness, showering happiness, uplifting
> happiness, and pervading (rapturous) happiness.

According to the Visuddhimagga (IV, 99) the jhāna-factor pīti is the
“pervading happiness” which is the “root of absorption”. When pīti is
developed in samatha it inhibits the hindrance which is ill-will
(vyāpāda). However, keen understanding is needed in order to know
whether there is akusala pīti which arises with attachment or kusala
pīti. Even when one thinks that one has wholesome enthusiasm about a
meditation subject, there may be clinging. The jhāna-factor pīti takes
an interest in the meditation subject without clinging. Wholesome pīti
which delights in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha or in another
meditation subject refreshes the mind and then there is no aversion, no
boredom as to kusala.

Another jhāna-factor is sukha, happy feeling. This jhāna-factor is not
pleasant bodily feeling, but it is happy mental feeling or somanassa.
Sukha which is developed in samatha is happy feeling about a meditation
subject. However, as we know, happy feeling arises also with attachment.
Paññā should know precisely when happy feeling is akusala and when it is
kusala. The jhāna-factor which is wholesome sukha inhibits the
hindrances which are restlessness and regret (uddhacca and kukkucca).
When there is wholesome happy feeling about a meditation subject,
restlessness and regret do not arise.

Pīti and sukha are not the same. *Sukha*, which is translated as
happiness, bliss, ease or joy, is happy feeling. Pīti, which is
translated as joy, rapture, zest, and sometimes also as happiness, is
not feeling; it is not vedanākkhandha, but saṅkhārakkhandha (the khandha
which is all cetasikas, except vedanā and saññā [(92)](#FOOT92)). When
reading the English translations, we have to find out from the context
which cetasika is referred to, pīti or sukha.

The Visuddhimagga (IV, 100) states concerning the difference between
happiness (pīti) and bliss (sukha):

> And whenever the two are associated, happiness (pīti) is the
> contentedness at getting a desirable object, and bliss (sukha) is the
> actual experiencing of it when got. Where there is happiness there is
> bliss (pleasure); but where there is bliss there is not necessarily
> happiness. Happiness is included in the formations aggregate
> (saṅkhārakkhandha) ; bliss is included in the feeling aggregate
> (vedanākkhandha). If a man exhausted in a desert saw or heard about a
> pond on the edge of a wood, he would have happiness; if he went into
> the wood’s shade and used the water, he would have bliss...

The jhāna-factor *samādhi* or concentration is the cetasika which is
*ekaggatā* cetasika. This cetasika arises with every citta and its
function is to focus on an object. Each citta can experience only one
object and ekaggatā cetasika focuses on that one object. Ekaggatā
cetasika or samādhi can be kusala as well as akusala. Samādhi when it is
developed in samatha is wholesome concentration on a meditation subject.
Together with samādhi there must be right understanding which knows
precisely when the citta is kusala citta and when akusala citta and
which knows how to develop calm, otherwise the right concentration of
samatha will not grow. If one tries very hard to concentrate but right
understanding is lacking, there may be attachment to one’s effort to
become concentrated, or, if one cannot become concentrated, aversion may
arise. Then calm cannot grow. If there is right understanding there are
conditions for samādhi to develop. The Visuddhimagga (XIV, 139) states
concerning samādhi:

> It puts (ādhiyati) consciousness evenly (samaṁ) on the object, or it
> puts it rightly (sammā) on it, or it is just the mere collecting
> (samādhāna) of the mind, thus it is concentration (samādhi). Its
> characteristic is non-wandering, or its characteristic is
> non-distraction. Its function is to conglomerate conascent states as
> water does bath powder. It is manifested as peace. Usually its
> proximate cause is bliss. It should be regarded as steadiness of the
> mind, like the steadiness of a lamp’s flame when there is no draught.

Samādhi inhibits kāmacchandha (sensuous desire). When there is right
concentration on a wholesome subject of meditation, one is at that
moment not hindered by kāmacchandha.

Summarising the five jhāna-factors, necessary for the attainment of the
first stage of jhāna, they are:

- vitakka, applied thinking
- vicāra, sustained thinking
- pīti, enthusiasm, rapture or happiness
- sukha, happy feeling or bliss
- samādhi, concentration

The Atthasālinī (Expositor I, Book I, Part V, chapter I, 165) states
concerning the jhāna-factors which inhibit the hindrances:

> ...For it is said that the Hindrances are opposed to the jhāna-factors,
> which are hostile to them and dispel and destroy them. Likewise it is
> said, in the “Peṭakopadesa”, that concentration is opposed to sensuous
> desire, rapture (pīti) to ill-will, initial application of mind
> (vitakka) to sloth and torpor, bliss (sukha) to flurry and worry
> (uddhacca and kukkucca), sustained application of mind (vicāra) to
> perplexity (vicikicchā, doubt)...

The jhāna-factors have to be developed in order to temporarily eliminate
the hindrances. For the person who wants to develop the jhāna-factors
and attain jhāna a great deal of preparation is required. We read in the
Visuddhimagga (II, 1 and III, 1) that the person who wants to cultivate
samatha should be well established in sīla (morality), which is purified
by such qualities as fewness of wishes, contentment, effacement,
seclusion, energy and modest needs. Sīla will become more perfected by
the observation of ascetic practices (as described in Ch II of the
Visuddhimagga), which pertain mostly to the monk with regard to the use
of his robes, his almsfood and his place of dwelling.

In the Buddha’s time laypeople too could attain jhāna, if they had
accumulated the inclination and skill to develop it and if they would
lead a life which was compatible with its development [(93)](#FOOT93).
One should lead a secluded life and many conditions have to be
fulfilled. Jhāna is quite incompatible with sense desires. One has to be
“quite secluded from sense desires...” in order to attain jhāna, as we
read in many suttas [(94)](#FOOT94).

The Visuddhimagga (IV, 81) explains that sense-desires are incompatible
with the attainment of jhāna. The development of jhāna is not for
everyone. Jhāna cannot be attained if one leads a “worldly life”, full
of sense-pleasures, instead of a life of “fewness of wishes, seclusion,
modest needs”.

The Visuddhimagga (III, 129) states that one should sever anything which
can be an impediment to the development of samatha. Impediments are, for
example, travelling and sickness, and also the place where one lives can
be an impediment. One should avoid living in a monastery which, for
various reasons, is unfavourable to the development of samatha. Thus,
even before one begins to develop samatha, many conditions have to be
fulfilled.

For the development of samatha one has to apply oneself to a suitable
subject of meditation. There are forty meditation subjects which can
condition calm and these are the following:

- 10 kasina exercises, which are, for example, kasinas (disks) of
 particular colours, the earth kasina or the kasina of light.
- 10 loathsome subjects (in Pāli: asubha), the “cemetery meditations”.
- 10 recollections, comprising the recollection of the Buddha, the
 Dhamma, the Sangha, virtue, generosty, deities, and also the
 recollections which are: mindfulness of death, mindfulness of the
 body, mindfulness of breathing and the recollection of peace
 (nibbāna).
- 1 The perception of repulsiveness in nutriment.
- 1 The definition of the four elements (earth, water, fire and wind).
- 4 brahma-vihāras (divine abidings), comprising: loving kindness
 (mettā), compassion (karuṇā), altruistic joy (muditā) and equanimity
 (upekkhā, which in this case is not upekkhā vedanā or indifferent
 feeling, but the wholesome cetasika which is tatramajjhattatā).
- 4 meditation subjects for the development of arūpa-jhānas
 (immaterial jhānas), which will be dealt with later on.

Not all subjects are suitable for everybody, it depends on the
individual which subject is a means for him to develop calm. If there is
right understanding of the way to become calm by means of a suitable
meditation subject, calm can grow, even in our daily life. Loving
kindness and compassion, for instance, can and should be developed in
our daily life, when we are in the company of other people, and then
there are kusala cittas instead of akusala cittas. Recollection of the
Dhamma includes also reflection on the teachings and this is beneficial
for everybody; it helps one to begin to understand life. While we
reflect with kusala citta on the teachings or on one of the other
meditation subjects, moments of calm can arise if we do not cling to
calm.

In the Visuddhimagga it is explained how one can develop higher degrees
of calm by means of a meditation subject. It is explained (Vis. III,
119) that meditation subjects are learned by sight, by touch and by
hearsay (words), depending on the nature of the subject. As regards the
subjects which are learned by sight (such as coloured kasinas and the
cemetery meditations), the Visuddhimagga (IV, 31) states that in the
beginning one has to look closely at the meditation subject, and that
later on one acquires a mental image (“sign”, in Pāli: nimitta) of it;
one no longer needs to look at the original object. At first the mental
image is still unsteady and unclear, but later on it appears “a hundred
times, a thousand times more purified...” The original object, for
example a coloured kasina or the earth kasina, could have flaws, but the
perfected mental image which is acquired when one is more advanced, does
not have the imperfections of the original object one was looking at in
the beginning. This perfected image is called the counterpart sign
(paṭibhāga nimitta).

At the moment the “counterpart sign” appears there is a higher degree of
calm and concentration is more developed. This stage is called
“access-concentration” (upacāra samādhi). The citta is not jhānacitta,
it is still kāmāvacara citta (of the sense sphere), but the hindrances
do not arise at the moment of “access concentration”. However, the
jhāna-factors are not developed enough yet to attain jhāna, and
moreover, there are still other conditions needed to attain it. One has
to “guard the sign” (nimitta) in order not to lose the perfected mental
image one has developed. “Access concentration” is already very
difficult to attain, but “guarding the sign” which is necessary in order
to attain jhāna is also very difficult. The conditions for guarding the
sign are, among others, the right dwelling place, suitable food, and
avoidance of aimless talk. One should “balance” the five “spiritual
faculties” (indriyas) which are the following cetasikas:

- saddhā (confidence in wholesomeness)
- viriya (energy)
- sati (mindfulness)
- samādhi (concentration)
- paññā (wisdom)

Confidence should be balanced with wisdom so that one has not confidence
uncritically and groundlessly. Concentration should be balanced with
energy, because if there is concentration but not enough energy there
will be idleness and jhāna cannot be attained. Too much energy and not
enough concentration leads to agitation and then one cannot attain jhāna
either. All five indriyas should be balanced.

From the foregoing examples we see that samatha cannot be cultivated
without a basic understanding and careful consideration of the realities
taught in the Abhidhamma which are in fact the realities of daily life.
One should know precisely when the citta is kusala citta and when it is
akusala citta. One should know which realities the jhāna-factors are and
one should realize as regards oneself whether or not the jhāna-factors
are developed. One should know whether or not the cetasikas which are
the five indriyas (faculties) are developed, whether or not they are
balanced. If one does not have right understanding of all these
different factors and conditions necessary for the attainment of “access
concentration” and of jhāna, one is in danger of taking for “access
concentration” what is not “access concentration” and taking for jhāna
what is not jhāna. Neither “access concentration” nor jhāna can be
attained without having cultivated the right conditions.

Not all meditation subjects lead to jhāna, some have only “access
concentration” as their result, such as the recollections of the Buddha,
the Dhamma and the Sangha. Some meditation subjects lead only to the
first stage of rūpa-jhāna [(95)](#FOOT95), some to all stages of
rūpa-jhāna. The meditation subject which is mindfulness of breathing can
lead to all stages of rūpa-jhāna. This meditation subject which is
considered by many to be relatively easy, is one of the most difficult.
One has to be mindful of one’s in-breath and out-breath where they touch
the tip of the nose or the upper-lip. This meditation subject is not
learnt by sight, but by touch: the in-breath and out-breath are the
“sign” (nimitta) one has continuously to give attention to. We read in
the Visuddhimagga (VIII, 208):

> For while other meditation subjects become clearer at each higher
> stage, this one does not: in fact, as he goes on developing it, it
> becomes more subtle for him at each higher stage, and it even comes to
> the point at which it is no longer manifest.

Further on (VIII, 211) we read:

> Although any meditation subject, no matter what, is successful only in
> one who is mindful and fully aware, yet any meditation subject other
> than this one gets more evident as he goes on giving it his attention.
> But this mindfulness of breathing is difficult, difficult to develop,
> a field in which only the minds of Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas
> [(96)](#FOOT96), and Buddhas’s sons are at home. It is no trivial
> matter, nor can it be cultivated by trivial persons. In proportion as
> continued attention is given to it, it becomes more peaceful and more
> subtle. So strong mindfulness and understanding are necessary here.
>
> Mindfulness of breathing is most difficult, “it is no trivial matter”,
> as the Visuddhimagga stated. The Buddha and his great disciples were
> endowed with great wisdom and other excellent qualities and thus, for
> them it was a “field” in which their minds were at home.

When one continues to be mindful of breathing, the in-breaths and
out-breaths become more and more subtle and thus harder to notice. We
just read in the quotation that strong mindfulness and understanding are
necessary here. Not only in vipassanā, but also in samatha, mindfulness,
sati, and understanding, paññā, are necessary, but the object of
awareness in samatha is different from the object of awareness in
vipassanā. In samatha the object of awareness is one among the forty
meditation subjects and the aim is the development of calm. In vipassanā
the object of awareness is any nāma or rūpa which appears at the present
moment through one of the six doors, and the aim is to eradicate the
wrong view of self and eventually all defilements. Through samatha
defilements can be temporarily subdued, but the latent tendencies of
defilements are not eradicated; when there are conditions for akusala
cittas they arise again. We read in the Gradual Sayings (Book of the
Sixes, chapter VI, paragraph 6, Citta Hatthisāriputta) that even the
monk who can attain jhāna may “disavow the training” and return to the
layman’s life. We read that when the Buddha was staying near Vārānasi,
in the Deer Park at Isipatana, a number of “elders” were having a
conversation on Abhidhamma. Citta Hatthisāriputta interrupted their talk
from time to time. Mahā Koṭṭhita said to him:

> “Let not the venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta constantly interrupt the
> elders’ Abhidhamma talk; the venerable Citta should wait until the
> talk is over!”
>
> And when he had thus spoken, Citta’s friends said: “The venerable Mahā
> Koṭṭhita should not censure the venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta. A
> wise man is the venerable Citta and able to talk to the elders on
> Abhidhamma.”
>
> “It is a hard thing, sirs, for those who know not another person’s
> ways of thought. Consider, sirs, a person who, so long as he lives
> near the Master or a fellow-teacher in the holy life, is the most
> humble of the humble, the meekest of the meek, the quietest of the
> quiet; and who, when he leaves the Master or his fellow-teachers,
> keeps company with monks, nuns, lay-disciples, men and women, rajahs,
> their ministers, course-setters or their disciples. Living in company,
> untrammelled, rude, given over to gossip, passion corrupts his heart;
> and with his heart corrupted by passion, he disavows the training and
> returns to the lower life...
>
> Consider again a person who, aloof from sensuous appetites ...enters and
> abides in the first jhāna. Thinking: ‘I have won to the first jhāna’,
> he keeps company ...Living in company, untrammelled, rude, given over to
> gossip, passion corrupts his heart; and with his heart corrupted by
> passion, he disavows the training and returns to the lower life...”

The same is said about the other stages of jhāna. We then read that
Citta Hatthisāriputta disavowed the training and returned to the lower
life. But not long after that he “went forth” (became a monk) again. We
read:

> And the venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta, living alone, secluded,
> earnest, ardent, resolved, not long after, entered and abode in that
> aim above all of the holy life - realizing it here and now by his own
> knowledge - for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from home
> to the homeless life; and he knew: “Birth is destroyed, the holy life
> is lived, done is what was to be done, there is no more of this.”
>
> And the venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta was numbered among the
> arahats.

Even if one can attain the highest stage of jhāna, one’s heart can still
become “corrupted by passion”, as we read in the sutta. When Citta
Hatthisāriputta had attained arahatship, he had realized the “aim above
all of the holy life”. The “hindrances” could not arise any more.

Through vipassanā, hindrances are eradicated in the successive stages of
enlightenment. The sotāpanna (who has attained the first stage of
enlightenment) has eradicated the hindrance which is doubt (vicikicchā);
the anāgāmī (who has attained the third stage of enlightenment) has
eradicated sensuous desire (kāmacchandha), ill-will (vyāpāda) and regret
(kukkucca); the arahat has eradicated sloth and torpor (thīna and
middha) and restlessness (uddhacca), he has eradicated all defilements.
