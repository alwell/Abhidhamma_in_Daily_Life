Planes of Existence 
===================

We are born, we die and then we are born again. It is beyond control in
which plane of existence we will be reborn; it depends on the kamma
which produces the paṭisandhi-citta (rebirth-consciousness) after the
cuti-citta (dying-consciousness) has fallen away.

At this moment we are living in the human plane. Human life, however, is
very short. When this life is over we do not know in which plane we will
be reborn. Most people do not like to think of the shortness of human
life; they are absorbed in what they experience through the sense-doors
and on account of these experiences they are happy or unhappy. However,
we should realize that happiness and unhappiness are only mental
phenomena which arise because of conditions and fall away again. Our
whole life is a sequence of phenomena which arise and fall away again.

Many religions teach about heaven and hell. In what respect are the
Buddhist teachings different? Do we just have to believe in heaven and
hell? Through the Buddhist teachings we learn to study realities, to
study cause and effect in life. Each cause brings about its appropriate
result. People perform good and bad deeds and these deeds bring
different results; they can cause birth in different planes of
existence. A plane of existence is the place where one is born. Birth in
a woeful plane is the result of a bad deed and birth in a happy plane is
the result of a good deed. Since the deeds of beings are of many
different degrees of kusala and akusala, the results are of many
different degrees as well. There are different woeful planes and
different happy planes of existence.

The animal world is a woeful plane. We can see how animals devour one
another and we find that nature is cruel. The animal world is not the
only woeful plane. There are different hell planes. The akusala vipāka
in hell is more intense than the sufferings which can be experienced in
the human plane. The descriptions of hells in the Buddhist teachings are
not merely allegories; the experience of unpleasant things through eyes,
ears, nose, tongue and bodysense is akusala vipāka and akusala vipāka is
reality. Life in a hell plane is not permanent; when one’s lifespan in a
hell plane is over there can be rebirth in another plane.

Apart from the animal plane and the hell planes, there are other woeful
planes. Birth in the plane of petas (ghosts) is the result of akusala
kamma. Beings in that plane have a deformed figure and they are always
hungry and thirsty.

Furthermore, there is the plane of asuras (demons). The objects which
are experienced in the asura plane are not as enjoyable as the objects
which can be experienced in the human plane. There are four classes of
woeful planes in all.

Birth as a human being is a happy rebirth. In the human plane there is
opportunity for the development of kusala. One can study Dhamma and
learn to develop the way leading to the end of defilements, to the end
of birth and death. Birth in the human plane is kusala vipāka, but
during one’s lifespan in this plane there are both kusala vipāka and
akusala vipāka. Each person experiences different results in life: there
are gain and loss, honour and dishonour, praise and blame, happiness and
misery. It is due to kamma whether someone is born into pleasant or
unpleasant surroundings, whether he belongs to a family which is
well-to-do or which is poor. The experience of pleasant and unpleasant
things through eyes, ears, nose, tongue and bodysense are the results of
kamma.

Other happy planes, apart from the human plane, are the heavenly planes.
In the heavenly planes there is more kusala vipāka than in the human
plane and less akusala vipāka. There are several heavenly planes and
although life in a heavenly plane lasts a very long time, it is not
permanent. The woeful planes, the human plane and the six heavenly
planes which are deva planes, are sensuous planes of existence. Sensuous
planes of existence are planes where there is seeing, hearing, smelling,
tasting, the experience of tangible object through the bodysense and
other kāmāvacara cittas (cittas which are of the sensuous plane of
consciousness). There are eleven classes of sensuous planes of existence
in all.

Those who see the disadvantages of sense-impressions may cultivate
jhāna; they can be reborn in higher heavenly planes which are not
sensuous planes. Those who attain rūpa-jhāna can be reborn in
rūpa-brahma-planes where there are less sense-impressions. There are
sixteen rūpa-brahma planes in all. One of them is the asañña-satta plane
[(86)](#FOOT86) where there is only rūpa, not nāma. Those who have
attained the highest stage of rūpa-jhāna and who wish to have no
consciousness at all, can be reborn without citta; for them there is
only a body. These beings have seen the disadvantages of consciousness;
even happiness is a disadvantage, since it does not last.

Those who see the disadvantages of rūpa cultivate arūpa-jhāna. If they
attain arūpa-jhāna they can be reborn in arūpa-brahma planes where there
is no rūpa. There are four classes of arūpa-brahma planes. Beings born
in these planes have only nāma, not rūpa. One may wonder how there can
be beings which only have rūpa or beings which only have nāma. When
right understanding of nāma and rūpa has been developed realities will
be seen as only elements which arise because of conditions, not a being,
not a person, no self. One will come to understand that, under the
appropriate conditions, there can be rūpa without nāma and nāma without
rūpa.

There are thirty-one classes of planes of existence in all, namely:

- 4 woeful planes
- 1 human plane
- 6 deva planes

*The above are 11 sensuous planes*

- 16 rūpa-brahma planes
- 4 arūpa-brahma planes

We read in the Gradual Sayings (Book of the Sevens, chapter VI,
paragraph 9a, Amity) about the value of wholesome deeds. They can bring
pleasant results for a long time and cause birth in different happy
planes. We read that the Buddha told the monks about his births in
different happy planes. The Buddha said:

Monks, be not afraid of deeds of merit. It is a name for happiness, that
is, meritorious deeds. For well I know, monks, that deeds of merit done
for a long time have a ripening, a blossoming, which is pleasing, joyous
and lovely for a long time.

For seven years I fostered thoughts of amity, and then for seven ages of
the world’s rolling on and rolling back I came not again to this world.
Then when the world rolled on, I reached the sphere of Radiance; then
when the world rolled back, I won to Brahmā’s empty palace. Then, monks,
I became Brahmā, great Brahmā, the conqueror, unconquered, all-seeing,
all-powerful. Thirty-six times I was Sakka, the deva-king. Many times
seven was I a Wheel-turning rajah, just, righteous, conquering the four
ends of the earth, bringing stability to the country, possessing the
seven gems...

As we have seen, the fact that beings are born in different planes of
existence is due to their accumulated kamma. Plane of existence is the
place or world where one is born. Plane of existence is not the same as
plane of citta. There are different planes of citta depending on the
object (ārammaṇa) the citta experiences. There are four different planes
of citta which are the following:

1. kāmāvacara cittas (sensuous plane of citta or kāma-bhūmi)
2. rūpāvacara cittas (plane of rūpa-jhānacittas)
3. arūpāvacara cittas (plane of arūpa-jhānacittas)
4. lokuttara cittas (plane of supramundane cittas experiencing nibbāna)

Kāmāvacara cittas can be classified as asobhana cittas (cittas not
accompanied by sobhana cetasikas) and as kāma-sobhana cittas (cittas of
the sensuous plane of consciousness, accompanied by sobhana cetasikas).

Kāmāvacara cittas arise in thirty planes of existence; they do not arise
in the asañña-satta plane, where there is no nāma, only rūpa. Even in
the arūpa-brahma-planes there are kāmāvacara cittas.

As regards kāma-sobhana cittas, they can arise even in woeful planes.
Furthermore, they arise in the human plane, in the deva planes, in the
rūpa-brahma planes and in the arūpa-brahma planes. They arise in thirty
planes of existence, the asañña-satta plane excepted. Not all types,
however, arise in all planes of existence.

As regards asobhana cittas, they can arise in thirty planes of
existence, but not all types arise in all planes. Lobha-mūla-cittas
(cittas rooted in attachment) can arise in thirty planes; even in the
rūpa-brahma planes and arūpa-brahma planes lobha-mūla-cittas can arise.
Dosa-mūla-cittas (cittas rooted in aversion) arise in the eleven
sensuous planes of existence. It is clinging to sense objects which
conditions dosa; when one does not obtain the pleasant object one likes,
one has aversion. Dosa-mūla-cittas do not arise in the rūpa-brahma
planes or in the arūpa-brahma planes. So long as beings live in the
rūpa-brahma planes and in the arūpa-brahma planes there are no
conditions for dosa. Moha-mūla-cittas (cittas rooted in ignorance) arise
in thirty planes of existence; all those who are not arahats have moha
and thus moha-mūla-cittas arise in all planes of existence, except in
the asañña-satta plane.

As we have seen, not only akusala cittas, but also ahetuka cittas are
asobhana cittas (cittas which are not accompanied by sobhana cetasikas).
As regards the asobhana cittas which are ahetuka, the ahetuka cittas
which arise in a process of cittas experiencing an object through one of
the sense-doors, can arise only in the planes of existence where there
are sense impressions. Seeing-consciousness and hearing-consciousness
arise in the eleven sensuous planes of existence (the four woeful
planes, the human being plane and the six heavenly planes which are
sensuous planes, the deva planes), and they arise also in fifteen
rūpa-brahma planes, thus, they arise in twenty-six planes of existence.
They do not arise in the arūpa-brahma planes where there is no rūpa.

Smelling-consciousness, tasting-consciousness and body-consciousness
arise only in the eleven sensuous planes of existence. Thus, they do not
arise in the rūpa-brahma planes and in the arūpa-brahma planes.

Pañca-dvārāvajjana-citta (five-door-adverting-consciousness),
sampaṭicchana-citta (receiving-consciousness) and santīraṇa-citta
(investigating-consciousness) arise in all planes where there are
sense-impressions, thus, they arise in twenty-six planes: in the eleven
sensuous planes and in fifteen rūpa-brahma planes; the asañña-satta
plane is excepted.

The mano-dvārāvajjana-citta (mind-door-adverting-consciousness) arises
in all planes where there is nāma, thus, it arises in thirty planes.

People are inclined to speculate about the place where they will be
reborn. Would we like to be reborn in the human plane? We cling to life
in the human plane and we do not always realize the many moments of
akusala vipāka we are bound to receive in this world: we are threatened
by calamities such as war and hunger; we are subject to old age,
sickness and death. Some people would like to be reborn in a heavenly
plane; they like to experience pleasant things through the senses. One
may wish for rebirth in a heavenly plane, but whether or not this will
happen depends on one’s kamma. Birth is result, it does not take place
without cause. If one performs many good deeds one cultivates the cause
which will bring a pleasant result but there is no way to know when the
result will take place, this is beyond control.

Are we afraid of death? Most people want to prolong their lives. They
fear death because they feel uncertain of the future. If one is not an
ariyan (a noble person who has attained enlightenment) there may be
rebirth in hell. We do not like to think of rebirth in a woeful plane,
but there may be deeds performed in the past which can cause rebirth in
hell. Even the Buddha was in one of his former lives born in hell
[(87)](#FOOT87). It is useless to think of hell with aversion and fear,
but the thought of hell is beneficial when it reminds us to develop
kusala at this moment, instead of akusala.

We read in the Kindred Sayings (V, Mahā-vagga, Kindred Sayings on
Streamwinning, chapter VI, paragraph 4, Visiting the sick) that while
the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu, in Banyan
Park, Mahānāma asked him how a wise lay-follower who is sick should be
admonished by another wise lay-follower. The Buddha said:

> A wise lay-disciple, Mahānāma, who is sick ...should be admonished by
> another wise lay-disciple with the four comfortable assurances, thus:
> “Take comfort, dear sir, in your unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,
> saying: He is the Exalted One, Arahat, fully enlightened One ...Teacher
> of devas and mankind, a Buddha, an Exalted One. Take comfort, dear
> sir, in your unwavering loyalty to the Dhamma, thus: Well proclaimed
> is the Dhamma ...Take comfort, dear sir, in your unwavering loyalty to
> the Sangha ...Take comfort, dear sir, in your possession of the virtues
> dear to the Ariyans...” A wise lay-disciple, Mahānāma, who is
> sick ...should be admonished by another wise lay-disciple with these four
> comfortable assurances.
>
> Then, supposing he has longing for his parents, he should thus be
> spoken to:
>
> If he say: ”I have longing for my parents”, the other should reply:
> “But, my dear sir, you are subject to death. Whether you feel longing

> for you to abandon the longing you have for your parents.”
>
> If he should say: “That longing for my parents is now abandoned,” the

Being subject to birth is dangerous. No rebirth at all in any plane of
existence is better than birth even in the highest heavenly plane. If
one wants to have no more rebirth right understanding of realities
should be developed in order to realize the four ariyan (noble) Truths.
Then one is on the way leading to the end of rebirth.

The first ariyan Truth is the truth of dukkha. If we could experience,
for instance, that seeing at this moment, hearing, attachment or any
other nāma or rūpa which appears now is only an element which arises and
falls away, we would have more understanding of the truth of dukkha.
What arises and falls away cannot give satisfaction, it is dukkha. The
second ariyan Truth is the truth of the origin of dukkha. Craving is the
origin of dukkha. Through the development of the eightfold Path there
will be less craving, less clinging to nāma and rūpa. When there finally
is no more craving, there will be an end to rebirth, and this is the end
of dukkha. The third ariyan Truth is the extinction of dukkha, which is
nibbāna, and the fourth ariyan Truth is the Path leading to the
extinction of dukkha, which is the eightfold Path.

We read in the Mahā-parinibbāna-sutta (Dialogues of the Buddha II, no.
16, chapter II, 1-4):

> ...The Exalted One proceeded with a great company of the monks to
> Kotigāma; and there he stayed in the village itself.
>
> And at that place the Exalted One addressed the monks, and said: “It
> is through not understanding and grasping four Ariyan Truths, O monks,
> that we have had to run so long, to wander so long in this weary path
> of rebirth, both you and I!”
>
> “And what are these four?”
>
> “The Ariyan truth about dukkha; the Ariyan truth about the cause of
> dukkha; the Ariyan truth about the cessation of dukkha; and the Ariyan
> truth about the path that leads to that cessation. But when these
> Ariyan truths are grasped and known the craving for future life is
> rooted out, that which leads to renewed becoming is destroyed, and
> then there is no more birth!”
